I have rewritten some of the proofs in [KS]. Of course, I'm not suggesting that my wording is better than that of Kashiwara and Schapira! I just tried to make explicit a few points which are implicit in [KS]. 

This is a work in progress. So far, there are comments only about the first ten chapters. I'm planning to read the whole book, but I'm progressing very slowly.

The notation of [KS] will be freely used. We will sometimes write $\B^\A$ for $\Fct(\A,\B)$, $\alpha_i$ for $\alpha(i)$, $fg$ for $f\circ g$, and some parenthesis might be omitted. 

Following a suggestion of Pierre Schapira's, we shall denote projective limits by $\lim$ instead of $\plim$, and inductive limits by $\coli$ instead of $\ilim$. 

Thank you to Pierre Schapira for his interest!%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{U-categories and U-small categories}\label{ucat}
% 
Here are a few comments about the definition of a $\U$-category on p. 11. Let $\U$ be a universe. Say that an element of $\U$ is a $\U$-set. The following definitions are used in [KS]:

Definition 1. A $\U$-category is a category $\C$ such that, for all objects $X,Y$, the set $\Hom_\C(X,Y)$ of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ is equipotent to some $\U$-set. 

Definition 2. The category $\C$ is $\U$-small if in addition the set of objects of $\C$ is equipotent to some $\U$-set. 

One could also consider the following variant:

Definition 3. A $\U$-category is a category $\C$ such that, for all objects $X,Y$, the set $\Hom_\C(X,Y)$ is a $\U$-set. 

Definition 4. The category $\C$ is $\U$-small if in addition the set of objects of $\C$ is a $\U$-set. 

Note that a category $\C$ is a $\U$-category in the sense of Definition 1 if and only if there is a $\U$-category in the sense of Definition 3 which is isomorphic to $\C$, and similarly for $\U$-small categories.\bigskip

\centerline{\fbox{In this text we shall always use Definitions 3 and 4.}}
%
\section{Typos and details}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
P. 11, Definition 1.2.1, Condition (b): $\Hom(X,X)$ should be $\Hom_{\C}(X,X)$. 

\n P. 14, definition of $\text{Mor}(\C)$. As the hom-sets of $\C$ are not assumed to be disjoint, it seems better to define $\text{Mor}(\C)$ as a category of functors. 

%% 

\n P. 18, Definition 1.2.16. The category $\C_{X'}$ is attached to the functor $F:\C\to\C'$ and to the object $X'\in\C'$. One often thinks of an object $(X,F(X)\to X')$ of $\C_{X'}$ as being an object of $X$ of $\C$ equipped with a morphism $F(X)\to X'$. This justifies the abusive but useful notation $X\in\C_{X'}$, which is an abbreviation for: ``firstly, $X$ is an object of $\C$, and, secondly, a morphism $F(X)\to X'$ is either supposed to be given, or obvious from the context''. For instance, if $X$ is an object of $\C$, then $X\in\C_X$ usually means $(X,\id_X)\in\C_X$. This abuse is especially useful when we have a functor $G:\C\to\C''$ and we consider an inductive limit (which may or may not exist in $\C''$) of the form 
%
\begin{equation}\label{convnot}
\coli_{X\in\C_{X'}}G(X).  
\end{equation}
% 
There is a similar remark for projective limits. 

\n P. 20, Remark 1.3.5: ``the category $\U$-\textbf{Cat} whose objects are the small $\U$-categories ...'' If one adheres to the definitions given in [KS], the set of all small $\U$-categories does not exist. If one uses (as we do) the definitions given in Section \ref{ucat} p. \pageref{ucat}, such a set does exist. 

\n P. 21, after Definition 1.3.10. It might be worth mentioning the fact that a quasi-inverse to a given equivalence is unique up to unique isomorphism. 

\n P. 25, Corollary 1.4.6. Due to the definition of $\U$-small category used in this text, the category $\C_A$ of the corollary is no longer $\U$-small, but only canonically isomorphic to some $\U$-small category.

\n P. 25, proof of Corollary 1.4.6 (second line): $\hy_{\C}$ should be $\hy_{\C'}$. 

\n P. 29, Equalities (1.5.8) and (1.5.9). Denoting vertical composition by $\circ$ and horizontal composition by $*$, these equalities read as follows: 
$$
(\eta*L)\circ(L*\e)=L,\quad (R*\eta)\circ(\e*R)=R.
$$

\n P. 33, Exercise 1.19: the arrow from $L_1\circ R_1\circ L_2$ to $L_1$ should be $\eta_1\circ L_2$ instead of $\varepsilon_1\circ L_2$. 

\n Pp 36-43, Section 2.1. Let $\alpha:I\to\C,\beta:I^\op\to\C$ be as in [KS]. Then the graphs (see Comment~\ref{graph} p. \pageref{graph}) of $\coli\alpha\in\C^\vee$ and $\lim\beta\in\C^\wedge$, and the condition that these functors are representable, depend only on the graphs of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

\n P. 37, Remark 2.1.5: ``Let $I$ be a small set'' should be ``Let $I$ be a small category''. 

\n P. 40, Lemma 2.1.11. It is easy to see that the converse holds. In other words, the lemma can be stated as follows: If $\C$ is a category, $\alpha:\C\to\C$ the identity functor, and $S$ an object of $\C$, then $S$ represents $\coli\alpha$ if and only if $S$ is terminal. 

\n P. 41, sixth line: (i) should be (a). 

\n P. 42, sixth line: ``belong to $\text{Mor}(\C)$'' should be ``belong to $\text{Mor}_0(\C)$''.

\n P. 52, fourth line: $\text{Mor}(I,\C)$ should be $\text{Fct}(I,\C)$. 

\n P. 53, Part (i) (c) of the proof of Theorem 2.3.3 (line 2): ``$\beta\in\text{Fct}(J,\A)$'' should be ``$\beta\in\text{Fct}(J,\C)$''.

\n P. 54, second display: we should have $i\to\varphi(j)$ instead of $\varphi(j)\to i$. 

\n P. 56, Corollary 2.4.6. It would be better, I think, to write the right-hand side of (2.4.1) as 
$$
\lim_{\substack{\longrightarrow\\ (A\to F(X))\in(\C^A)^\op}}\h_{\C'}(G(X),B)
$$ 
instead of 
$$ 
\lim_{\substack{\longrightarrow\\ (A\to F(X))\in\C^A}}\h_{\C'}(G(X),B). 
$$

\n P. 58: The abbreviation $j\in J^i$ for $(i\to\varphi(j))\in J^i$ is used for the first time. This abbreviation is used a lot throughout the book (and will be systematically used in this text: see \eqref{convnot} p. \pageref{convnot}). Of course, it is easy for the reader to guess the meaning of this notation, but it might be nice to add a couple of words explaining it. 

\n P. 58: Corollary 2.5.3: The assumption that $I$ and $J$ are small is not necessary. (The statement does not depend on the universes axiom.) 

\n P. 58: Proposition 2.5.4. Parts (i) and (ii) could be replaced with the statement: ``If two of the functors $\varphi,\psi$ and $\varphi\circ\psi$ are cofinal, so is the third one''.

\n Pp. 63-64, statement and proof of Corollary 2.7.4: all the $h$ are slanted, but they should be straight.

\n P. 63, proof of Proposition 2.7.5: $(\C')^\wedge$ should be $\C^\wedge$. 

\n P. 65, Exercise 2.7 (i). I think the statement of the exercise is not exactly the intended one. Here is a possible formulation. 

``Map'' shall mean ``morphism in $\Set$''. For any map $X\to Y$ and any $y\in Y$ we denote by $X_y$ the fiber above $y$. Let $C\to B$ be a map. Define the functors 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\Set_B\ar[yshift=.7ex]{r}{L}&\Set_C\ar[yshift=-.7ex]{l}{R}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
by
$$
L(X):=C\times_BX,\quad R(Y):=\prod_{b\in B}\ \Hom_\Set(C_b,Y_b). 
$$ 
Then $(L,R)$ is a pair of adjoint functors. 

\n P. 74, last four lines: $\alpha$ should be replaced by $\varphi$. 

\n P. 75. Throughout the subsection about the IPC Property, one can (I think) assume that $\A$ is a big category. This applies in particular to Corollary 3.1.12 p.~77, corollary used in this generalized form at the end of the proof of Proposition 6.1.16 p. 136.

\n P. 80, last display: a ``$\displaystyle\colim$'' is missing.

\n Pp. 83 and 85: Statement of Proposition 3.3.7 (iv) and (v) p. 83: $k$ might be replaced by $R$. [The statement (I think) applies to rings, not only to fields.] Proof of Proposition 3.3.7(iv) p. 83: ``Proposition 3.1.6'' should be ``Theorem 3.1.6''. Same typo on p. 85, line 6. 

\n P. 84, Proposition 3.3.13. It is clear from the proof (I think) that the intended statement was the following one. If $\C$ be a category admitting finite inductive limits and if $A:\C^\op\to\Set$ be a functor, then we have 
$$
\C\text{ small and }\C_A\text{ filtrant }\implies A\text{ left exact }\implies\C_A\text{ filtrant}.
$$

\n P. 85, proof of Proposition 3.3.13, proof of the implication ``$\C_A$ filtrant $\implies$ $A$ commutes with finite projective limits''. One can either use the comment made above about Theorem 3.1.6 p. 74, or notice that $\C$ can be assumed to be small. (The argument is the same in both cases.) 

\n P. 88, Proposition 3.4.3 (i). It would be better to assume that $\C$ admits small inductive limits. 

\n P. 89, last sentence of the proof of Proposition 3.4.4. The argument is slightly easier to follow if $\psi'$ is factorized as 
$$
(J_1)^{j_2}\to(J_1)^{\psi_2(j_2)}\to(K_1)^{\psi_2(j_2)}\to(K_1)^{\p_2(i_2)}.
$$

\n P. 89, proof of part (i) of Proposition 3.4.5. The last sentence might be justified by Proposition 3.2.2 p. 78 in [KS].

\n P. 89, Proposition 3.4.5 (iii). The proof uses implicitly the following fact: If $F$ is a cofinally small filtrant category, then there is a small \emph{filtrant} full subcategory of $F$ cofinal to $F$. This results immediately from Corollary 2.5.6 p. 59 and Proposition 3.2.4 p. 79. This fact also justifies the sentence ``We may replace ``filtrant and small'' by ``filtrant and cofinally small'' in the above definition'' page 132, lines 4 and 5 of [KS].

\n P. 90, Exercise 3.2: ``Proposition 3.1.6'' should be ``Theorem 3.1.6''.

\n P. 115, just before the ``q.e.d.'': $i_1\circ g=i_2\circ g$ should be $g\circ i_1=g\circ i_2$. 

\n P. 120, proof of Theorem 5.2.6. We define $u':X'\to F$ as the element of $F(X')$ corresponding to $(u,u_0)\in F(X)\times_{F(X_1)}F(Z_0)$ under the natural bijection. 

\n P. 121, proof of Proposition 5.2.9. The fact that, in Proposition 5.2.3 p. 118, only part (iv) needs the assumption that $\C$ admits small coproducts is implicitly used in the sequel of the book. 

\n P. 128, proof of Theorem 5.3.9. Last display: $\sqcup$ should be $\cup$. The simplest in fact would be to put 
$$
\Ob(\F_n):=\{Y_1\sqcup_XY_2\ |\ X\to Y_1\text{ and }X\to Y_2\text{ are morphisms in }\F_{n-1}\}.
$$
Also, just before the ``q.e.d.'', Corollary 5.3.5 should be Proposition 5.3.5. 

\n P. 132. Line 3: It would be slightly better to replace ``for small and filtrant categories $I$ and $J$'' with ``for small and filtrant categories $I$ and $J$, and functors $\alpha:I\to\C,\beta:J\to\C$''. Line 4: $\Hom_\C(A,B)$ should be $\Hom_{\Ind(\C)}(A,B)$. 

\n P. 132, lines 4 and 5: \guillemotleft We may replace ``filtrant and small'' by ``filtrant and cofinally small'' in the above definition\guillemotright. It might be worth mentioning that this follows from Proposition 3.2.2 p. 78. 

\n P. 132, Corollary 6.1.6. The following fact is implicit. Let $\C\xrightarrow{F}\C'\xrightarrow{G}\C''$ be functors, let $X'$ be in $\C'$, and assume that $G$ is fully faithful. Then the functor $\C_{X'}\to\C_{G(X')}$ induced by $G$ is an isomorphism. 

\n P. 133, line 2, proof of Proposition 6.1.8: ``It is enough to show that $A$ belongs to $\Ind(\C)$''. More generally: Let $I\xrightarrow{\alpha}\C\xrightarrow{F}\C'$ be functors. Assume that $F$ is fully faithful, and that there is an $X$ in $\C$ such that $F(X)\simeq\coli F(\alpha)$. Then $X\simeq\coli\alpha$. The proof is obvious. 

\n P. 133, Proposition 6.1.9. ``There exists a unique functor ...'' should be ``There exists a functor ... Moreover, this functor is unique up to unique isomorphism.'' See Comment~1 in Section \ref{s271} p. \pageref{s271}. 

\n P. 134, proof of Proposition 6.1.12: ``$\C_A\times\C_{A'}$'' should be ``$\C_A\times\C'_{A'}$'' (twice). 

\n P. 136, proof of Proposition 6.1.16: see the comment made above about page 75. 

\n P. 136, Proposition 6.1.18. Part (i) is a particular case of the restatement of Proposition 2.1.7 p. 39 given above. 

\n P. 136, proof of Proposition 6.1.18. Line 2 (of the proof): ``Corollary 1.6.14'' should be ``Corollary 1.6.15''. Last line: ``the cokernel of $(\alpha(i),\beta(i))$'' should be ``the cokernel of $(\p(i),\psi(i))$''. 

\n P. 138, second line of Section 6.2: ``the functor $``\displaystyle\lim_{\longrightarrow}"$ is representable in $\C$'' should be ``the functor $``\displaystyle\lim_{\longrightarrow}"\alpha$ is representable in $\C$''. Next line: ``natural functor'' should be ``natural morphism''. 

\n P. 140, Corollary 6.3.2. For the uniqueness up to unique isomorphism, see Comment~1 in Section \ref{s271} p. \pageref{s271}. 

\n P. 143, third line of the proof of Proposition 6.4.2: $\{Y_I\}_{I\in I}$ should be $\{Y_i\}_{i\in I}$. 

\n P. 144, proof of Proposition 6.4.2, step (ii), second sentence: It might be better to state explicitly the assumption $X_\nu^i\in\C_\nu$ ($\nu=1,2$). 

\n P. 146, Exercise 6.3. ``Let $\C$ be a small category'' should be ``Let $\C$ be a category''. 

\n P. 150, before Proposition 7.1.2. One could add after ``This implies that $F_{\SSS}$ is unique up to unique isomorphism'': Moreover we have $Q^\dagger F\simeq F_{\SSS}\simeq Q^\ddagger F$. 

\n P. 153, statement of Lemma 7.1.12. The readability might be slightly improved by changing $s:X\to X'\in\mathcal S$ to $(s:X\to X')\in\mathcal S$. Same for line 4 of the proof of Lemma 7.1.21 p. 157.  

\n P. 160, second line after the diagram: ``commutative'' should be ``commutative up to isomorphism''.

\n P. 160, line 7 when counting from the bottom to the top: $F(s)$ should be $Q_{\mathcal S}(s)$. 

\n P. 168, line 9: ``$f:X\to Y$'' should be ``$f:Y\to X$''. 

\n P. 169, Lemma 8.1.2 (ii). The fact that the notion of group object is independent of the choice of a universe $\U$ such that $\C$ is a $\U$-category is implicit in the proof. A way to make this point clear is to define the notion of a group object structure on an object $G$ of $\C$ without the axiom of universes. As in [KS], we use the notation $G(X):=\Hom_\C(X,G)$. A group object structure on $G$ is given by a family of maps $\mu_X:G(X)^2\to G(X)$ such that $\mu_X$ is a group multiplication for all $X$ in $\C$, and the map $G(Y)\to G(X)$ is a morphism of groups for all morphism $X\to Y$ in $\C$. 

\n P. 169. Lemma 8.2.3 might be stated as follows. Part (i) would remain unchanged. Part (ii) would become part (iii), and part (ii) would be replaced by the following. ``Assume that $X_1\sqcup X_2$ exists in $\C$ and denote by $i_k:X_k\to X_1\sqcup X_2$ the coprojection ($k=1,2$). Then the morphisms $p_1$ and $p_2$ defined by (8.2.1) satisfy (8.2.2).'' One could also replace, in the statement of Corollary 8.2.4, the sentence ``If $X_2\times X_2$ exists in $\C$, then $X_1\sqcup X_2$ also exists'' by ``If $X_2\times X_2$ exists in $\C$, then $X_1\sqcup X_2$ also exists, and conversely''. 

\n P. 171, Definition 8.2.7. It would be better (I think) to give this definition just before Proposition 8.2.15 p. 173. 

\n P. 172, proof of Lemma 8.2.10, first line: ``composition morphism'' should be ``addition morphism''. 

\n P. 179, about one third of the page: ``a complex 
\begin{tikzcd}X\ar{r}{u}&Y\ar[yshift=0.7ex]{r}{v}\ar[yshift=-0.7ex]{r}[swap]{w}&Z\end{tikzcd}'' 
should be ``a sequence 
\begin{tikzcd}X\ar{r}{u}&Y\ar[yshift=0.7ex]{r}{v}\ar[yshift=-0.7ex]{r}[swap]{w}&Z\end{tikzcd}''.

\n P. 181, second line of the proof: $h\circ f^2$ should be $f^2\circ h$.  

\n P. 182, proof of the equivalence (iii) $\iff$ (iv) in Proposition 8.3.14. The authors say that the equivalence is obvious. I agree, but here are a few more details. The implication (iv) $\implies$ (iii) is indeed obvious in the strongest sense of the word. The implication (iii) $\implies$ (iv) can be proved as follows. Assume (iii). The proofs of (iii) $\implies$ (i) and (iii) $\implies$ (ii) show that our morphisms $h$ and $k$ satisfy $g\circ h=\id_{X''}$ and $k\circ f=\id_{X'}$. As we have $f\circ k+h\circ g=\id_X$ by assumption, (iv) holds. 

\n P. 186, Corollary 8.3.26. The proof reads: ``Apply Proposition 5.2.9''. One could add: ``and Proposition 5.2.3 (v)''. 

\n P. 187, Proposition 8.4.3. More generally, if $F$ is a left exact additive functor between abelian categories, then, in view of the observations made on p. 185 (and especially Exercise 8.17), $F$ is exact if and only if it sends epimorphisms to epimorphisms. (A solution to the important Exercise 8.17 is given in Section \ref{817} p. \pageref{817}.) 

\n P. 188. In the second diagram $Y'\overset{l'}{\m}Z$ should be $Y'\overset{l'}{\m}X$. 

\n P. 190, proof of Proposition 8.5.5 (a) (i): all the $R$ should be $R^\op$, except for the last one.

\n P. 191: The equality $\psi(M)=G\otimes_RM$ is used in the second display, whereas $\psi(M)=M\otimes_RG$ is used in the third display. It might be better to use $\psi(M)=M\otimes_{R^\op}G$ both times.

\n P. 191, proof of Theorem 8.5.8 (iii): ``the product of finite copies of $R$'' should be ``the product of finitely many copies of $R$''.

\n P. 196, Proposition 8.6.9, last sentence of the proof of (i) $\implies$ (ii): ``Proposition 8.3.12'' should be ``Lemma 8.3.12''.

\n P. 218, middle of the page: ``$b:=\inf(J\setminus A)$'' should be ``$b:=\inf(J\setminus A')$'' (the prime is missing).

\n P. 218, proof of Lemma 9.2.5, first sentence: ``Proposition 3.2.4'' should be ``Proposition 3.2.2''.

\n P. 220, part (ii) of the proof of Proposition 9.2.9, last sentence of the first paragraph: $s(j)$ should be $\tilde s(j)$.

\n Pp 224-228, from Proposition 9.3.2 to the end of the section. The notation $G^{\sqcup S}$, where $S$ is a set, is used twice (each time on p. 224), and the notation $G^{\coprod S}$ is used many times in the sequel of the section. I think the two pieces of notation have the same meaning. If so, it might be slightly better to uniformize the notation.

\n P. 229, proof of 9.4.3 (i): it might be better to write ``containing $\mathcal S$ strictly'' (or ``properly''), instead of just ``containing $\mathcal S$''. Proof of 9.4.4: ``The category $\C^X$ is nonempty, essentially small ...'': the adverb ``essentially'' is not necessary since $\C$ is supposed to be small.

\n P. 237: ``Proposition 9.6.3'' should be ``Theorem 9.6.3'' (twice). Proof of Corollary 9.6.6, first display: ``$\psi:\C\to\C$'' should be ``$\psi:\C\to\mathcal I_{inj}$''. (By the way, I find the notation $\mathcal I_{inj}$ surprising: I would have expected either $\mathcal I$ or $\C_{inj}$.) End of proof of Corollary 9.6.6: it might be slightly more precise to write ``$X\to\iota(\psi(X))=K^{\Hom_\C(X,K)}$'' instead of ``$X\to\psi(X)=K^{\Hom_\C(X,K)}$''.

\n$\bu$ P. 24, change of Universe. 
% 
\begin{cm}\label{graph} 
The following crucial fact is implicit in [KS]. If $\C$ is a $\U$-category and $\mathcal V$ a universe containing $\U$, then $\C^\wedge_\U$ is a full subcategory of $\C^\wedge_\mathcal{V}$. 

More generally, if $\A$ is a full subcategory of $\B$, and $\C$ is a category, then $\A^\C$ is a full subcategory of $\B^\C$.

Let me say that the \textbf{graph} of a functor $F$ from $\A$ to $\B$ is the functor induced by $F$ from $\A$ to the full subcategory of $\B$ whose objects are the $F(X),X\in\A$. 

If $G$ is another functor from $\A$ to $\B$, then the morphisms from $F$ to $G$, and the condition that such a morphism is an isomorphism, depend only on the graphs of $F$ and $G$.

Important particular case: $\B$ is the category of $\U$-sets. 
%
\end{cm} 

%

\n$\bu$ P. 24, the Yoneda Lemma. Let $\C$ be a category, let $h:\C\to\C^\wedge$ be the Yoneda embedding, let $F$ be in $\C^\wedge$, let $A$ be in $\C$, and define 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
F(A)\ar[yshift=0.7ex]{r}{\phi_A}&\Hom_{\C^\wedge}(h(A),F)\ar[yshift=-0.7ex]{l}{\psi_A}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
by 
$$
\phi_A(a)_X(f):=F(f)(a),\quad\psi_A(\theta):=\theta_A(\id_A)
$$
for 
$$
a\in F(A),\quad X\in\C,\quad f\in\Hom_\C(X,A),\quad\theta\in\Hom_{\C^\wedge}(h(A),F).
$$ 
Then $\phi_A$ and $\psi_A$ are inverse bijections. In the particular case where $F$ is equal to $h(B)$ for some $B$ in $\C$, we get 
$$
\phi_A(a)=h(a)\in\Hom_{\C^\wedge}(h(A),h(B)).
$$
This shows that $h$ is fully faithful. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 25, Corollary 1.4.7. A statement slightly stronger than Corollary 1.4.7 of [KS] can be proved more naively:

A morphism $f:A\to B$ in a category $\C$ is an isomorphisms if and only if 
$$
\Hom_\C(X,f):\Hom_\C(X,A)\to\Hom_\C(X,B)
$$
is (i) surjective for $X=B$ and (ii) injective for $X=A$.

Proof: By (i) there a $g:B\to A$ satisfying $f\circ g=\id_B$, yielding $f\circ g\circ f=f$, and (ii) implies $g\circ f=\id_A$. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 38, \pr\ 2.1.6. Here is an example of a functor $\alpha:I\to\C^J$ such that $\co\alpha$ exists in $\C^J$ but there is a $j$ in $J$ such that $\co\ (\rho_j\circ\alpha)$ does not exist in $\C$. This example is taken from Section 3.3 of the book \textbf{Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory} of G.M. Kelly:\medskip 

\centerline{\href{http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html}{http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html}}

The category $J$ has two objects, 1, 2; it has exactly one nontrivial morphism; and this morphism goes from 1 to 2. The category $\C$ has exactly three objects, 1, 2, 3, and exactly four nontrivial morphisms, $f,g,h,g\circ f=h\circ f$, with 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
1\ar{r}{f}&2\ar[yshift=.7ex]{r}{g}\ar[yshift=-.7ex]{r}[swap]{h}&3.
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
Then $\C^J$ is the category of morphisms in $\C$. It is easy to see that the morphism 
%
\begin{equation}\label{38}
f\xrightarrow{(f,h)}g 
\end{equation}
%
in $\C^J$ is an epimorphism, and that this implies that the coproduct 
$$
g\sqcup_fg,
$$ 
taken with respect to (\ref{38}), exists and is isomorphic to $g$ (the coprojections being given by the identity of $g$). It is also easy to see that the coproduct $2\sqcup_12$ does not exist in $\C$. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 39, Proposition 2.1.7. The following slightly stronger statement holds, statement independent of the Universes Axiom. Let $I, J, \C$ be categories and let 
$$
(X_{ij})_{(i,j)\in I\times J}
$$ 
be an inductive system in $\C$. Assume that $\coli_jX_{ij}$ exists in $\C$ for all $i$, and that 
\begin{equation}\label{limlim}
\coli_i\coli_jX_{ij}
\end{equation}
exists in $\C$. Then $\coli_{i,j}X_{ij}$ exists in $\C$ and is isomorphic to (\ref{limlim}).

%

\n$\bu$ P. 40, Proposition 2.1.10. Here is a slightly more general statement: Let 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
I\ar{r}{\alpha}&\A\ar{d}[swap]{G}\ar{r}{F}&\B\\
&\C
\end{tikzcd}
$$
be a diagram of categories and functors. Assume that $\A$ admits inductive limits indexed by $I$, that $G$ commutes with such limits, and that for each $Y\in\B$ there is a $Z\in\C$ and an isomorphism 
$$
\Hom_\B(F(\ ),Y)\simeq\Hom_\C(G(\ ),Z). 
$$
Then 
\begin{equation}\label{2.1.10}
F\text{ commutes with inductive limits indexed by }I.
\end{equation}
Indeed, we have for any $Y\in\B$ 
$$ 
\Hom_\B\left(F\left(\coli\alpha\right),Y\right)\simeq
\Hom_\C\left(G\left(\coli\alpha\right),Z\right)
\overset{\sim}{\to}
\Hom_\C\left(\coli G(\alpha),Z\right)
$$
$$
\overset{\sim}{\to}\lim \ \Hom_\C(G(\alpha),Z)\simeq\lim \ \Hom_\B(F(\alpha),Y).
$$

\n$\bu$ P. 52, Formula (2.3.6). The following observation will give rise to another proof of Corollary 3.2.6 p. 56 [see comment containing Display (\ref{241}) p. \pageref{241}]. Recall the setting: $\C\xleftarrow{\,\beta}J\xrightarrow{\p}I$, and $\p^\dagger(\beta):I\to\C$ is given by 
%
\begin{equation}\label{236}
\p^\dagger(\beta)(i)=\coli_{j\in J_i}\beta(j).
\end{equation}
%  
\cn Assume $\C=\Set$ (and $I$ and $J$ are small). Then $\p^\dagger(\beta)(i)$ is (in natural bijection with) the quotient of 
$$
\bigsqcup_j\ \beta(j)\times\h_I(\p(j),i) 
$$ 
by the smallest equivalence relation $\sim$ satisfying the following condition. If $s:j\to j'$ is a morphism in $J$, if $x$ is in $\beta(j)$, and if $u'$ is in $\h_I(\p(j'),i)$, then 
$$
(x,u'\circ\p(s))\sim(\beta(s)(x),u'). 
$$ 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 52, Theorem 2.3.3 (i). In [KS] the proof of Theorem 2.3.3 (i) is broken up in three steps (a), (b), (c). Here is a rewriting of step (c). In (b), the authors define a map 
$$
\Psi_{\alpha,\beta}:
\Hom_{\C^I}(\varphi^\dagger\alpha,\beta)\to
\Hom_{\C^J}(\alpha,\varphi_*\beta),
$$
and show that it is bijective. In particular, we have a bijection 
$$
f:=\Psi_{\alpha,\varphi^\dagger\alpha}:
\Hom_{\C^I}(\varphi^\dagger\alpha,\varphi^\dagger\alpha)\to
\Hom_{\C^J}(\alpha,\varphi_*\varphi^\dagger\alpha),
$$
and we must check that $f(\id_{\varphi^\dagger\alpha})$ is an isomorphism. To this end, we will define 
$$
u:\varphi_*\varphi^\dagger\alpha\to\alpha,
$$
and leave it to the reader to verify that $f(\id_{\varphi^\dagger\alpha})$ and $u$ are inverse isomorphisms. As 
$$
(\varphi_*\varphi^\dagger\alpha)_j:=\varphi^\dagger(\alpha)_{\varphi_j}:=\coli_{\varphi_{j'}\to\varphi_j}\alpha_{j'},
$$
we must define 
$$
u(\varphi_{j'}\to\varphi_j):\alpha_{j'}\to\alpha_j,
$$
that is, we must attach, to each morphism $\varphi_{j'}\to\varphi_j$, a morphism $\alpha_{j'}\to\alpha_j$. As $\varphi$ is fully faithful by assumption, there is an obvious way to do it. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 53, proof of Corollary 2.3.4. Here is a variant: 
$$
\coli_{i\in I}\coli_{j\in J_i}\alpha(j)\simeq
\coli_{j\in J}\coli_{i\in I^{\p(j)}}\alpha(j)\simeq
\coli_{j\in J}\alpha(j). 
$$ 
Here is a mild generalization. Let $I\xleftarrow{\p}K\xrightarrow{\psi}J$ be functors, let $M$ be the category defined in Definition 3.4.1 p . 87, and let $M\xrightarrow{\alpha}\C$ be a functor. Then we have 
$$ 
\coli_{i\in I}\coli_{(j,u)\in J^{\p(i)}}\alpha(i,j,u)\simeq
\coli_{(i,j,u)\in M}\alpha(i,j,u)\simeq
\coli_{j\in J}\coli_{(i,u)\in I_{\psi(j)}}\alpha(i,j,u). 
$$ 
To be on the safe side, let us say that the precise statement is this: if all the above inductive limits exist, then the above natural isomorphisms hold. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 55, Corollary 2.4.4 (iii). If $\Delta:\Set\to\Set^I$ is the diagonal functor, then there is a canonical bijection
$$
\coli\Delta S\simeq\pi_0(I)\times S.
$$
Slightly different proof: On the one hand we have 
$$
\pi_0(I):=\Ob(I)/\!\!\sim\ , 
$$
where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation defined on p. 18 of [KS]. On the other hand  we have by Proposition 2.4.1 p. 54
$$
\coli\Delta S\simeq(\Ob(I)\times S)/\!\!\approx\ ,
$$
where $\approx$ is the equivalence relation described in the proposition. In view of the definition of $\approx$ and $\sim$, we have 
$$
(i,s)\approx(j,t)\ \iff\ [i\sim j\text{ and }s=t].
$$  

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 56, proof of Corollary 2.4.6. We shall give two other proofs. Recall the statement: In the setting 
% 
\begin{equation}\label{241s}
A\in\C'\xleftarrow{F}\C\xrightarrow{G}\C''\ni B, 
\end{equation} 
% 
we have 
% 
\begin{equation}\label{241} 
\coli_{(X,b)\in\C_B}\Hom_{\C'}(A,F(X))\simeq 
\coli_{(X,a)\in(\C^A)^\op}\Hom_{\C''}(G(X),B). 
\end{equation} 
% 
Here  
$$
a\in\Hom_{\C'}(A,F(X)),\quad b\in\Hom_{\C''}(G(X),B). 
$$ 

\n{\em First proof.} Denote respectively by $L$ and $M$ the left and right-hand side of (\ref{241}), let 
$$
\alpha_{X,b}:\Hom_{\C'}(A,F(X))\to L,\quad\beta_{X,a}:\Hom_{\C''}(G(X),B)\to M
$$
be the coprojection, and define 
$$
f_{X,b}:\Hom_{\C'}(A,F(X))\to M,\quad g_{X,a}:\Hom_{\C''}(G(X),B)\to L
$$
by
$$
f_{X,b}(a):=\beta_{X,a}(b),\quad g_{X,a}(b):=\alpha_{X,b}(a).
$$
One easily checks that these maps define inverse bijections between $L$ and $M$. q.e.d. 

\n{\em Second proof.} For $X$ in $\C$ put 
$$
U(X):=\h_{\C'}(A,F(X)),\quad V(X):=\h_{\C''}(G(X),B). 
$$ 
We must show 
$$
\co_{X\in\C_B}U(X)\simeq\co_{X\in(\C^A)^\op}V(X). 
$$ 
\cn As observed in the comment containing Display (\ref{236}) p. \pageref{236}, both sets are in natural bijection with the quotient of 
$$
\bigsqcup_{X\in\C}\ U(X)\times V(X) 
$$ 
by the smallest equivalence relation $\sim$ satisfying the following condition. If $f:X\to Y$ is a morphism in $\C$, if $u$ is in $U(X)$, and if $v$ is in $V(Y)$, then 
$$
(u,V(f)(v))\sim(U(f)(u),v). 
$$ 
q.e.d.

\n$\bu$ P. 56, Lemma 2.4.7. Statement: If $I$ is a small category, $i_0$ is in $I$, and $k(i_0)\in\Set^I$ is the Yoneda functor $\Hom_I(i_0,?)$, then $\coli k(i_0)$ is a terminal object of $\Set$. Slightly different wording of the proof: For $X\in\Set$ we have (with self-explanatory notation)
$$
\Hom_\Set\left(\coli k(i_0),X\right)\simeq\Hom_{\Set^I}(k(i_0),\Delta X)\simeq X,
$$
the first isomorphism following from Exercise 2.8 p. 66, and the second one from the Yoneda Lemma. 

% 

\n$\bu$ P. 58, proof of implication (vi) $\implies$ (i) of Proposition 2.5.2. Here is a somewhat more direct proof of the fact that the obvious map  
\begin{equation}\label{om}
L_i:=\coli\Hom_I(i,\p)\to\pi_0(J^i)
\end{equation}
is bijective. (Recall that $\p:J\to I$ is a functor.) For $j\in J$ let 
$$
c_j:\Hom_I(i,\p(j))\to L_i
$$
be the canonical map. It is easy to check that the map 
$$
\Ob(J^i)\to L_i,\quad (j,i\overset{s}{\to}\p(j))\mapsto c_j(s)
$$
factors through $\pi_0(J^i)$, and that the induced map $\pi_0(J^i)\to L_i$ is an inverse to (\ref{om}).

\n$\bu$ P. 61, \pr\ 2.6.3 (i). Let $\C$ be a category and $A$ be in $\C^\wedge$. Consider the statements  
% 
\begin{equation}\label{263a}
\ic_{X\in\C_A}X\xrightarrow\sim A, 
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}\label{263b}
\co_{X\in\C_A}\h_\C(Y,X)\xrightarrow\sim A(Y)\text{ for all }Y\in\C,

\h_{\C^\wedge}(A,B)\xrightarrow\sim\lim_{X\in\C_A}B(X)\text{ for all }B\in\C^\wedge. 
\end{equation} 

\n\cn Clearly, (\ref{263b}) implies (\ref{263a}) and (\ref{263}), and the proof of (\ref{263b}) is straightforward. (See the comment containing Display (\ref{38}) p. \pageref{38} for the relationship between (\ref{263a}), (\ref{263b}), and (\ref{263}).) 

%%

\n$\bu$ P. 61, Proposition 2.6.3. Here is a Lemma implicitly used in the proof of Proposition 2.6.3 (ii) p. 61 of [KS]: 

Let $\alpha:I\to\A$ be a functor, let $A\in\A$ be the inductive limit of $\alpha$, let $\beta:I\to\A_A$ be the obvious functor, and let $a\in\A_A$ be the identity of $A$. Then the inductive limit of $\beta$ is $a$. 

Proof. Notation: if $I$ and $\C$ are categories, write $\Delta$ for the diagonal functor from $\C$ to $\C^I$. 

Let
$$
b=(b:B\to A)
$$
be a ``generic'' object of $\A_A$. We must check that there is a canonical bijection
%
\begin{equation}\label{1}
\Hom_{\A_A}(a,b)\simeq\Hom_{(\A_A)^I}(\beta,\Delta b).
\end{equation}
%
We have a canonical bijection  
%
\begin{equation}\label{2}
\Hom_\A(A,B)\simeq\Hom_{\A^I}(\alpha,\Delta B)
\end{equation}
%
and inclusions  
$$
\Hom_{\A_A}(a,b)\subset\Hom_\A(A,B),\quad
%
\Hom_{(\A_A)^I}(\beta,\Delta b)\subset\Hom_{\A^I}(\alpha,\Delta B).
$$
It is straightforward to check that (\ref{2}) induces (\ref{1}). 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 61, \pr\ 2.6.4. As often, the difference with the book is almost nil. Let $\U$ be a universe, let  
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
I\ar{r}{\alpha}&\C\ar{d}{h}\ar{r}{F}&\C'\\
&\C^\wedge
\end{tikzcd}
$$
be functors, and let $X$ be an object of $\C$. Assume that $I$ is a small category, $\C$ is a $\U$-category, $\C'$ is a big category, $h$ is the Yoneda embedding, and we have an isomorphism $\co\ (h\circ\alpha)\simeq h(X)$. Let $p_i:h(\alpha_i)\to h(X)$ be the $i$-th coprojection, let $q_i:\alpha_i\to X$ be the morphism $p_i(\alpha_i)(\id_{\alpha_i})$. Then the morphisms $F(q_i):F(\alpha_i)\to F(X)$ induce an isomorphism $\co\ (F\circ\alpha)\xrightarrow\sim F(X)$. 

\n{\em Proof}. By enlarging $\U$ we can assume that $\C'$ is a $\U$-category. Let $X'$ be in $\C'$. We know 
$$
A(X)\xrightarrow\sim\lim A(\alpha)\quad\forall\ A\in\C^\wedge 
$$ 
and we want to prove 
$$
\h_{\C'}(F(X),X')\xrightarrow\sim\lim\h_{\C'}(F(\alpha),X'). 
$$ 
It suffices to set $A(X):=\h_{\C'}(F(X),X')$. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ Pp 63 and 133. Notation 2.7.2 p. 63: The formula 
$$
(\widehat F(A))(V)=\coli_{U\in\C_A}\Hom_{\C'}(V,F(U))
$$
may also be written as 
$$
\widehat F(A)=\icolim_{U\in\C_A}F(U).
$$
\cn It might be worth stating explicitly the isomorphism 
$$
\widehat F\circ\hy_\C\simeq\hy_{\C'}\circ F,
$$
as well as the following fact. 

If $F$ is fully faithful, then $\widehat F(A)\circ F\simeq A$ for $A$ in $\C^\wedge$, or in other words
$$
(\circ F)\circ\widehat F\simeq\id_{\C^\wedge}.
$$
Indeed, we have 
$$
\widehat F(A)(F(X))=\coli_{Y\in\C_A}\Hom_{\C'}(F(X),F(Y))
$$
$$
\simeq\coli_{Y\in\C_A}\Hom_\C(X,Y)
=\left(\icolim_{Y\in\C_A}Y\right)(X)
\simeq A(X),
$$
the last isomorphism following from Proposition 2.6.3 (i) p. 61. 

In view of Proposition 6.1.9 p. 133, this implies (still assuming $F$ is fully faithful) that a given $B$ in $\Ind(\C')$ is isomorphic to $IF(A)$ for some $A$ in $\Ind(\C)$ if and only if $B\circ F$ is in $\Ind(\C)$ (in which case we have of course $A\simeq B\circ F$). (Here we view $\Ind(\C')$ as a subcategory of $\C'^\wedge$.)

\n$\bu$ P. 74, Theorem 3.1.6. Here is an immediate corollary: 

Let $I$ be a (not necessarily small) filtrant $\U$-category, $J$ a finite category, and $\alpha:I\times J^\op\to\Set$ a functor such that $\coli_i\alpha(i,j)$ exists in $\Set$ for all $j$. Then $\coli_i\lim_j\alpha(i,j)$ exists in $\Set$, and the natural map 
$$
\coli_i\lim_j\alpha(i,j)\to
\lim_j\coli_i\alpha(i,j)
$$ 
is bijective. 

This corollary is implicitly used in the proof of Proposition 3.3.13 p. 84. 

%%  

\n$\bu$ P. 74, Theorem 3.1.6. Here is a minor variant of part (i) of the proof of the implication (a)$\implies$(b). Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be functor from $I$ to $\Set$ (where $I$ is a small category); let $f$ and $g$ be morphisms from $\alpha$ to $\beta$; for each $i\in I$ let $\gamma_i\subset\alpha_i$ be the kernel of $(f_i,g_i)$; let 
$$
a_i:\alpha_i\to X:=\coli\alpha,\quad 
b_i:\beta_i\to Y:=\coli\beta,\quad 
c_i:\gamma_i\to Z:=\coli\gamma
$$ 
be the canonical maps; let $F,G:X\to Y$ be the obvious maps; and let $U\subset X$ be the kernel of $(F,G)$. The claim is that the natural map $\lambda:Z\to U$ is bijective. 

For each $u\in U$ put 
$$
A_u:=\{(i,z)\ |\ i\in I,\ z\in\gamma_i,\ a_i(z)=u\}.
$$ 
One easily checks 

\n$*\ A_u\ne\varnothing$ for all $u\in U$,

\n$*\ (i,z),(j,w)\in A_u\ \implies\ c_i(z)=c_j(w)$, 

\n$*$ there is a unique map $\mu:U\to Z$ such that $\mu(u)=c_i(z)$ whenever $(i,z)\in A_u$,

\n$*\ \lambda$ and $\mu$ are inverse bijections.

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 75, Proposition 3.1.8 (i). In the proof of Proposition 3.3.15 p. 85, a slightly stronger result is needed. We state and prove this stronger result.

Statement. Let 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
J\ar{r}{\p}&I\ar{r}{\theta}&L&K\ar{l}[swap]{\psi}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
be a diagram of categories. Assume that $\psi$ is cofinal, and that the obvious functor $\p_k:J_{\psi(k)}\to I_{\psi(k)}$ is cofinal for all $k$ in $K$. Then $\p$ is cofinal. 

Proof. Pick a universe making $I,J,K$ and $L$ small, and let $\alpha:I\to\Set$ be a functor. We have the following five bijections:
$$
\coli\ \alpha\circ\p\ \simeq\ 
%
\coli_{\ell\in L}\ \coli_{\theta(\p(j))\to\ell}\ \alpha(\p(j))\ \simeq\ 
%
\coli_{k\in K}\ \coli_{\theta(\p(j))\to\psi(k)}\ \alpha(\p(j))
$$
$$
\ \simeq\ \coli_{k\in K}\ \coli_{\theta(i)\to\psi(k)}\ \alpha(i)\ \simeq\ 
%
\coli_{\ell\in L}\ \coli_{\theta(i)\to\ell}\ \alpha(i)\ \simeq\ 
%
\coli\ \alpha.
$$
Indeed, the first and fifth bijections follow from Corollary 2.3.4 p. 53, the second and fourth bijections follow from the cofinality of $\psi$, the third bijection follows from the cofinality of $\p_k$. In view of Proposition 2.5.2 p. 57, this proves the claim.  

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 80, Lemma 3.2.8. As already pointed out, a ``$\displaystyle\colim$'' is missing in the last display. Also, we have functors $\xi_J:J\to K_J$ and $\varphi:K\to I$, so the composition $\varphi\circ\xi_J$ doesn't make sense at first sight. I don't understand the proof in [KS], and I'll suggest another argument. I think it is implicitly assumed that $\C$ admits small inductive limits. At any rate, I'll make this assumption. In the notation of the lemma as stated in [KS], put 
$$
L_1:=\coli\alpha,\quad
\beta_J:=\coli\alpha_J,\quad
L_2:=\coli\beta.
$$
Let 
$$
c_i:\alpha_i\to L_1,\quad 
c_{i,J}:\alpha_i\to\beta_J,\quad 
c_J:\beta_J\to L_2
$$
be the canonical morphisms ($c_{i,J}$ being defined only for $i\in J$). We easily check that 

\n$*$ the morphisms$f_i:=c_{\{i\}}\circ c_{i,\{i\}}:\alpha_i\to L_2$ induce a morphism $f:L_1\to L_2$, 

\n$*$ the morphisms $g_{i,J}:=c_i:\alpha_i\to L_1$ (with $i\in J$) induce a morphism $g_J:\beta_J\to L_1$, 

\n$*$ the morphisms $g_J$ induce a morphism $g:L_2\to L_1$, 

\n$*$ $f$ and $g$ are inverse isomorphisms.

I\xrightarrow\alpha\C\xrightarrow F\C', 
$$ 
assume that $I$ is finite, that $F$ is right exact, and that $\co\alpha$ exists in $\C$. Then $\co F\circ\alpha$ exists in $\C'$, and the natural morphism 
$$
\h_{\C'}(F(\co\alpha),X')\to\lim\h_{\C'}(F(\alpha),X')
$$ 
is an isomorphism. 

Let $X'$ be in $\C'$. It suffices to show that the natural morphism $\co F\circ\alpha\to\co\alpha$ is an isomorphism. Replacing Setting (\ref{241s}) p. \pageref{241s} with 
$$
Y\in\C\xleftarrow{\id_\C}\C\xrightarrow{F}\C'\ni X', 
$$ 
Statement (\ref{241}) p. \pageref{241} gives 
$$
\co_{X\in\C_{X'}}\h_\C(Y,X)\simeq\h_{\C'}(F(Y),X'),  
$$  
and \pr\ 3.3.2 follows immediately. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 88, proof of Proposition 3.4.3 (i). Here are more details. Introduce the following informal notation: 
$$
\p(i)\overset{u}{\longrightarrow}\psi(j),\quad 
j\overset{v}{\longrightarrow}j_0,\quad 
\p(i)\overset{u_0}{\longrightarrow}\psi(j_0),\quad 
\p(i')\overset{u'_0}{\longrightarrow}\psi(j_0). 
$$ 
Here $i$ and $i'$ are in $I$, and so on (each arrow representing a morphism in the obvious category). We have in particular 
$$
(i,j,u)\in M,\quad(i,j,u,v)\in M_{j_0},\quad(i,u_0)\in I_{\psi(j_0)}. 
$$
Applying Corollary 2.3.4 p. 53 to the obvious functor $M\to J$, we get 
$$
\coli\alpha\simeq
\coli_{j_0}\coli_{(i,j,u,v)}\alpha(i,j,u). 
$$ 
Define the functors 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
I_{\psi(j_0)}\ar[yshift=0.7ex]{r}{\xi}& M_{j_0}\ar[yshift=-0.7ex]{l}{\eta}
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
by 
$$
\xi(i,u_0):=(i,j_0,u_0,\id_{j_0}),\quad 
\eta(i,j,u,v):=(i,\psi(v)\circ u). 
$$
We claim that $(\eta,\xi)$ is a pair of adjoint functors. Let $f$ and $g$ denote morphisms 
$$
(i,\psi(v)\circ u)\overset{f}{\to}(i',u'_0),\quad 
(i,j,u,v)\overset{g}{\to}(i',j_0,u'_0,\id_{j_0}) 
$$ 
in $I_{\psi(j_0)}$ and $M_{j_0}$ respectively. To each $f$ as above we must attach a $g$ as above, and conversely. (We shall leave it to the reader to check that these constructions define the sought-for adjunction.) In fact, such an $f$ (respectively, such a $g$) is given uniquely by a $w:i\to i'$ such that 
$$
u'_0\circ\p(w)=\psi(v)\circ u. 
$$ 
We thus have inverse bijections $f\mapsto g$, $g\mapsto f$. This proves the claim. The claim implies that $\xi$ is cofinal, and we get 
$$
\coli\alpha\simeq
\coli_{j_0}\coli_{(i,u_0)}\alpha(i,j_0,u_0)=
\coli_j\coli_{(i,u)}\alpha(i,j,u).

$$
\Big((R*\eta)\circ(\e*R)\Big)*L=R*L,

R*\Big((\eta*L)\circ(L*\e)\Big)*L=R*L,

\n$\bu$ P. 116, proof of \pr\ 5.1.7 (i). Here is a very slightly different wording. Recall the statement: 

Let $\C$ be a category admitting finite inductive and projective limits in which epimorphisms are strict. Let us denote by $C_g$ the coimage of any morphism $g$ in $\C$. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism in $\C$ and $X\xr u C_f\xr v Y$ its factorization through $C_f$. Then $v$ is a monomorphism. 

To prove this, consider the \cd
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
X\ar[two heads]{d}\ar[two heads]{r}{u}&C_f\ar[two heads]{d}{a}\ar{r}{v}&Y\\
C_{a\circ u}\ar{ur}{c}\ar[two heads]{r}[swap]{b}&C_v.\ar{ru}
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
(The existence of $c$ is a very particular case of \pr\ \ref{fun} p. \pageref{fun}.) By (the dual of) \pr\ 5.1.2 (iv) p. 114, it suffices to show that $a$ is an isomorphism. As $a\circ u$ is a strict epimorphism, \pr\ 5.1.5 (i), (a) $\iff$ (b), p. 115, implies that $b$ is an isomorphism. Clearly, $c\circ b^{-1}$ is inverse to $a$.  

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 122, proof of Lemma 5.3.2. Here is a minor variant. Recall that $\F\subset\G$ are full subcategories of $\C$ and that $\F$ is strictly generating. We want to show that $\G$ is strictly generating. Let 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\C\ar{r}{\gamma}\ar{dr}[swap]{\p}&\G^\wedge\ar{d}{\rho}\\
&\F^\wedge,

be the natural functors ($\rho$ being the restriction). Let $X$ and $Y$ be in $\C$. We have 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\h_\C(X,Y)\ar{r}\ar{dr}[swap]{\sim}&\h_{\G^\wedge}(\gamma(X),\gamma(Y))\ar{d}\\
&\h_{\F^\wedge}(\p(X),\p(Y)). 
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
We want to prove that the horizontal arrow is bijective. The slanted arrow being bijective, i\sts\ that the horizontal arrow is surjective. Let $\xi$ be in $\h_{\G^\wedge}(\gamma(X),\gamma(Y))$. There is a (unique) $f$ in $\h_\C(X,Y)$ such that $\rho(\xi)=\p(f)$ and it suffices to prove $\xi=\gamma(f)$. Let $Z$ be in $\F$ and $z$ be in $\h_\C(Z,X)$. I\sts\ $\xi_Z(z)=f\circ z$. Let $W$ be in $\G$ and $w$ be in $\h_\C(W,Z)$. As $\F$ is strictly generating, i\sts\ $\xi_Z(z)\circ w=f\circ z\circ w$. We have 
$$
\xi_Z(z)\circ w=\xi_W(z\circ w)=\rho(\xi)_W(z\circ w)=\p(f)_W(z\circ w)
=f\circ z\circ w, 
$$ 
the first equality following from the functoriality of $\xi$.

\n$\bu$ P. 128, Theorem 5.3.9. To prove the existence of $\F$, one can also argue as follows. 

\n Lemma. Let $\C$ be a category closed by finite inductive limit, and let $\A$ be a small full subcategory of $\C$. Then 

\n(a) there is a small full subcategory $\B$ of $\C$ such that $\A\subset\B\subset \C$ and that $\A$ is closed by finite inductive limit, 

\n(b) there is a small full subcategory $\A'$ of $\C$ such that $\A\subset\A'\subset \C$ and that each finite inductive system in $\A$ has a limit in $\A'$.

\n Proof. Since there are only countably many finite categories up to isomorphism, (b) is clear. To prove (a), let $\A\subset\A'\subset\A''\subset\cdots$ be a tower of full subcategories obtained by iterating the argument used to prove (b), and let $\B$ be the union of the $\A^{(n)}$.

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 136, proof of \pr\ 6.1.18 (i). Here is a minor variant: If $\iota:\C\hookrightarrow\Ind(\C)$ is the inclusion functor and $(\p_i,\psi_i:\alpha_i\pa\beta_i)_{i\in I}$ is a small filtrant inductive system of parallel arrows in $\C$ whose limit in $\Ind(\C)$ is a pair of parallel arrows $f,g:A\pa B$ (that is, $A=\ic_i\ \alpha_i$, and so on...), then we have 
$$
\co_i\ \iota(\Coker(\p_i,\psi_i))\simeq
\co_i\ \Coker(\iota(\p_i),\iota(\psi_i))
$$
$$
\simeq
\Coker(\co_i\ \iota(\p_i),\co_i\ \iota(\psi_i))=
\Coker(f,g),
$$ 
the first isomorphism following from the right exactness of $\iota$. 

More generally, if $I$ is a small filtrant category, $J$ a finite category, and $\alpha:I\times J\to\C$ a functor, then the natural morphism 
$$
\co_j\co_i\iota(\alpha(i,j))\to\co_i\iota\left(\co_j\alpha(i,j)\right) 
$$ 
is an isomorphism. Indeed, $\co_j$ commutes with $\co_i$ for obvious reasons, and with $\iota$ because $\iota$ is right exact.

Let $F:\C\to\C'$ be a functor; let $X_0\in\C,X'_0\in\C'$ be objects; let $A\in\C^\vee$ be defined by $A(X):=\Hom_{\C'}(X'_0,F(X))$; let $\theta:\text{k}_\C(X_0)\to A$ be a morphism; and put $\tau:=\theta(X_0)(\id_{X_0})\in\Hom_{\C'}(X'_0,F(X_0))$.

\n$\bu$ P. 173, \pr\ 8.2.15. (See also Section \ref{169} p. \pageref{169}.) Recall the setting: $F:\C\to\C'$ is a functor between additive categories, and the claim is: $F$ is additive $\iff$ $F$ commutes with finite products. I think the authors forgot to prove the implication $\implies$. Let us do it. It suffices to show that $F$ commutes with $n$-fold products for $n=0$ or $n=2$. 

Case $n=0$: Put $X:=F(0)$. We must prove $X\simeq 0$. The equality $0=1$ holds in the ring $\Hom_\C(X,X)$ because it holds in the ring $\Hom_\C(0,0)$. As a result, the morphisms $0\to X$ and $X\to 0$ are inverse isomorphisms. 

Case $n=2$: Let $X_1,X_2$ be in $\C$. To check that the natural morphisms 
%
\be\label{173} 
F(X_1\oplus X_2)\rightleftarrows F(X_1)\oplus F(X_2)
\ee 
% 
are inverse isomorphisms, let $p_j:X_1\oplus X_2\to X_j$ and $i_j:X_j\to X_1\oplus X_2$ be the projections and coprojections, and apply Lemma 8.2.3 p. 169 to the morphisms $p_j,i_j,F(p_j),F(i_j)$. 

%% 

\n$\bu$ P. 176, Proposition 8.3.4. Here is a slightly different way of writing the proof of the isomorphism $\Coim f\simeq\Coker h$. Recall the statement: 

Let $\C$ be an additive category which admits kernels and cokernels. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism in $\C$. We have 
$$ 
\Coim f\simeq\Coker h,\text{ where }h:\Ker f\to X, 
$$ 
$$ 
\Ima f\simeq\Ker k,\text{ where }k:Y\to\Coker f.  
$$ 

Let us use the abbreviations 
$$
P:=X\times_YX,\quad p:=p_1-p_2:P\to X,\quad K:=\Ker f.
$$
We must show that $h:K\to X$ and $p:P\to X$ have ``same'' cokernel. Let $z:X\to Z$. We must check 
%
\begin{equation}\label{176a}
z\circ h=0\iff z\circ p=0.
\end{equation}
%
Let $W$ be in $\C$, and consider the conditions 
%
\begin{equation}\label{176b}
\Big[W\overset{a}{\to}K\implies z\circ h\circ a=0\Big]\iff\Big[W\overset{b}{\to}P\implies z\circ p\circ b=0\Big],
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}\label{176c}
\left.
\begin{matrix}
\Big[W\overset{c}{\to}X,f\circ c=0\implies z\circ c=0\Big]\\ 
\iff\\ 
\Big[W\overset{b_i\ }{\to}X,(i=1,2),f\circ b_1=f\circ b_2\implies z\circ b_1=z\circ b_2\Big]
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation}
It is clear that (\ref{176c}) holds, and that (\ref{176c})$\implies$(\ref{176b})$\implies$(\ref{176a}).

The proof shows the following: There is a natural isomorphism $\Coker h\xrightarrow{\sim}\Coim f$ whose composition with the natural morphism $\Coim f\to\Ima f$ is the obvious morphism $\text{obv}:\Coker h\to\Ima f$, and a natural isomorphism $\Ima f\xrightarrow{\sim}\Ker k$ whose composition with the natural morphism $\Coim f\to\Ima f$ is the obvious morphism $\text{obv}:\Coim f\to\Ker k$:

where $f^0$ is an epimorphism, $f^1$ and $f^3$ are monomorphisms, and $X^1\to X^2\to X^3$ and $Y^0\to Y^1\to Y^2$ are exact. Claim: $f^2$ is a monomorphism. 

Note that Lemma 8.3.12 can be stated as follows: $f:X\to Y$ is an epimorphism if and only if any subobject of $Y$ is the image of some subobject of $X$. 

We write $fx$ for the image of a subobject $x$ of $X$, and $fg$ for $f\circ g$.

\n\emph{Proof}. Put $x^2:=\Ker f^2$. Using the Lemma we see that there is a subobject $x^1$ of $X^1$ such that $x^2=a^1x^1$ (because $f^3$ is a monomorphism, $f^3a^2x^2=0$, and $X^1\overset{a^1}{\to}X^2\overset{a^2}{\to}X^3$ is exact), a subobject $y^0$ of $Y^0$ such that $f^1x^1=b^0y^0$ (because $b^1f^1x^1=0$ and $Y^0\overset{b^0}{\to}Y^1\overset{b^1}{\to}Y$ is exact), and a subobject $y^0$ of $Y^0$ such that $y^0=f^0x^0$ (because $f^0$ is an epimorphism). This yields  
$$
f^1a^0x^0=b^0f^0x^0=b^0y^0=f^1x^1,
$$
implying $a^0x^0=x^1$ (because $f^1$ is a monomorphism), and thus 
$$
0=a^1a^0x^0=a^1x^1=x^2.

I will just rewrite in a slightly less concise way the part of the proof which starts with the sentence ``Define $Y:=Y_0\times_XG_i$'' at the fifth line of the last paragraph of the proof, and goes to the end of the proof. 

It suffices to show that there is a morphism $a_0:G_i\to Y_0$ satisfying $l_0\circ a_0=\p$. Form the cartesian square 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
Y\ar{r}{b}\ar[swap]{d}{c}&Y_0\ar[tail]{d}{l_0}\\
G_i\ar[swap]{r}{\p}&X,
\end{tikzcd}

and the cocartesian square 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
Y\ar{r}{b}\ar[swap]{d}{c}&Y_0\ar{d}{\lambda}\\
G_i\ar[swap]{r}{a_1}&Y_1.
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
There is a morphism $l_1:Y_1\to X$ such that the following diagram commutes and has exact rows: 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
0\ar{r}&Y\ar[equal]{d}\ar{r}{(b,-c)}&Y_0\oplus G_i\ar[equal]{d}\ar{r}{(l_0,\p)}&X\\
&Y\ar{r}[swap]{(b,-c)}&Y_0\oplus G_i\ar{r}[swap]{(\lambda,a_1)}&Y_1\ar{r}\ar{u}[swap]{l_1}&0.
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
By the Five Lemma, $l_1$ is a monomorphism. We have $l_1\circ a_1=\p$ and $l_1\circ\lambda=l_0$; in particular $\lambda$ is a monomorphism. It suffices to show that $\lambda$ is an isomorphism: indeed, once we know that, we can set $a_0:=\lambda^{-1}\circ a_1$. As $(Y_0,g_0,l_0)$ is maximal, it is enough to prove that there is a morphism $g_1:Y_1\to Z$ such that $g_1\circ\lambda=g_0$. As $Z$ is injective and $c$ is a monomorphism by Lemma 8.3.11 (a) (i) p. 180, there is a morphism $d:G_i\to Z$ satisfying $d\circ c=g_0\circ b$. Now the existence of $g_1$ follows from the definition of $Y_1$.

If $\p_{{}_1}:(\C_0)^\wedge\to(\M_0)^\wedge$ is the functor induced by $\psi_{{}_0}$, and if $\lambda:\C\to(\C_0)^\wedge$ and $\lambda':\M\to(\M_0)^\wedge$ are the obvious functors, then the diagram 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}

(\C_0)^\wedge\ar{r}[swap]{\p_{{}_1}}&(\M_0)^\wedge

quasi-commutes, and $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ are fully faithful by Theorem 5.3.6 p. 124 and Lemma 3.3.9 p. 83.

\n$\bu$ P. 191, Step (a) of the proof of Theorem 8.5.8 (iv). Here is a slightly different wording of the argument. Assume that there is a finite set $F$, an epimorphism $R^F\epi M$, a small set $S$, and a monomorphism $M\m R^{\oplus S}$. We must show that $\psi(M)\to\psi(R^{\oplus S})$ is a monomorphism. There is a finite subset $F'$ of $S$ such that $M\m R^{\oplus S}$ factors as $M\m R^{F'}\m R^{\oplus S}$. Since $R^{F'}$ is a direct summand of $R^{\oplus S}$, the arrow $\psi(R^{F'})\to\psi(R^{\oplus S})$ is a monomorphism. In other words, we may assume $S=F'$, and we have to check that $\psi(M)\to\psi(R^{F'})$, or more explicitly $\psi(M)\to G^{F'}$, is a monomorphism. Applying the right exact functor $\psi$ to 
$$
R^F\epi M\m R^{F'},
$$
we get 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
K\ar[tail]{r}{i}\ar[bend right]{rrr}{0}&G^F\ar[two heads]{r}{p}&\psi(M)\ar{r}{f}&G^{F'},
\end{tikzcd}
$$
where $K:=\Ker(f\circ p)$, and it suffices to prove $p\circ i=0$. Applying $\p$ we obtain
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\p(K)\ar{r}{\p(i)}\ar[bend right]{rrr}{0}&R^F\ar{r}{\p(p)}&\p(\psi(M))\ar{r}{\p(f)}&R^{F'}.
\end{tikzcd}
$$
As $\p$ is faithful, it suffices to check $\p(p)\circ\p(i)=0$. This equality follows from the commutative diagram
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\p(K)\ar[equal]{d}\ar{rrr}{0}&&&R^{F'}\ar[equal]{d}\\
\p(K)\ar{r}{\p(i)}&R^F\ar[equal]{d}\ar{r}{\p(p)}&\p(\psi(M))\ar{r}{\p(f)}&R^{F'}\ar[equal]{d}\\
&R^F\ar{r}&M\ar[tail]{r}\ar{u}&R^{F'}.

\textbf{Proposition.} If $F$ is a cofinally small filtrant category, then there is a small \emph{filtrant} full subcategory of $F$ cofinal to $F$. 

This fact, which results immediately from Corollary 2.5.6 p. 59 and Proposition 3.2.4 p. 79, is used very often.

\n\textbf{Proposition.} Let $F:\C\to\C'$ be an equivalence, and $A$ an object of $\C'$. Then the natural functors $\C_A\to\C'_A$ and $\C^A\to\C'^A$ are equivalences. 

\n\emph{Proof}. Exercise.

\n\textbf{Corollary.} (a) Equivalences are cofinal, right small, and left small.\\ (b) A category equivalent to a filtrant category is filtrant.\\ (c) Equivalences are exact. 

\n\emph{Proof}. (a) follows immediately from the Proposition. In view of (a), (b) follows from Proposition 3.2.2 p. 78 in [KS]. (c) follows from the Proposition and (b). QED

\n$\bu$ A category is essentially small if and only if its set of isomorphism classes of object is small.

\n$\bu$ The phrase ``the object $\Xi$ is unique up to unique isomorphism'' usually means ``the category $\mathcal X$ (which is implicit but clear from the context) is equivalent to a category with at most one morphism''. Here is a typical example: If $\C$ is a category and $F$ is in $\C^\wedge$, then the phrase ``a representative $X$ of $F$ is unique up to unique isomorphism'' means the following: Let $\C_F^{\text i}$ be the full subcategory of $\C_F$ whose objects are the couples $(X,X\to F)$ of $\C_F$ such that $X\to F$ is an isomorphism. Then $\C_F^{\text i}$ is equivalent to a category with at most one morphism.

\n$\bu$ The following fact is often used in an implicit way. Let $I$ be a small category, let $\C$ be a category, and let $\A$ be the full subcategory of $\C^I$ whose objects are those $\alpha$ in $\C^I$ such that $\coli\alpha$ exists in $\C$. Then $\coli$ is a functor from $\A$ to $\C$. There is a similar observation for projective limits.
%
\section{Universes (p. 9)}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The book starts with a few statements which are not proved, a reference being given instead. Here are the proofs.

A \textbf{universe} is a set $\mathcal U$ satisfying 

(i) $\varnothing\in\mathcal U$,

(ii) $u\in U\in\mathcal U\implies u\in \mathcal U$,

(iii) $U\in\mathcal U\implies\{U\}\in\mathcal U$,

(iv) $U\in\mathcal U\implies\mathcal P(U)\in\mathcal U$,

(v) $I\in\mathcal U$ and $U_i\in\mathcal U$ for all $i$ $\implies$ $\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\in\mathcal U$,

(vi) $\mathbb N\in\mathcal U$.

\n We want to prove:

(vii) $U\in\mathcal U\implies\bigcup_{u\in U}u\in\mathcal U$,

(viii) $U,V\in\mathcal U\implies U\times V\in\mathcal U$,

(ix) $U\subset V\in\mathcal U\implies U\in\mathcal U$,

(x) $I\in \mathcal U$ and $U_i\in\mathcal U$ for all $i$ $\implies$ $\prod_{i\in I}U_i\in\mathcal U$.

\n[We have kept Kashiwara and Schapira's numbering of Conditions (i) to (x).]

\n Obviously, (ii) and (v) imply (vii), whereas (iv) and (ii) imply (ix). Axioms (iii), (vi), and (v) imply

(a) $U,V\in\mathcal U\implies\{U,V\}\in\mathcal U$,

\n and thus

(b) $U,V\in\mathcal U\implies(U,V):=\{\{U\},\{U,V\}\}\in\mathcal U$.

\n\textbf{Proof of (viii).} If $u\in U$ and $v\in V$, then $\{(u,v)\}\in\mathcal U$ by (ii), (b), and (iii). Now (v) yields 
$$
U\times V=\bigcup_{u\in U}\ \bigcup_{v\in V}\ \{(u,v)\}\in\mathcal U.\ \square
$$
Assume $U,V\in\mathcal U$, and let $V^U$ be the set of all maps from $U$ to $V$. As $V^U\in\mathcal P(U\times V)$, Statements (viii), (iv), and (ii) give

(c) $U,V\in\mathcal U\implies V^U\in\mathcal U$. 

\n\textbf{Proof of (x).} As 
$$
\prod_{i\in I}\ U_i\in\mathcal P\left(\left(\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\right)^I\right),
$$
(x) follows from (v), (c), and (iv). 
%
\section{Horizontal and vertical compositions (p. 19)}%%%%%%%
%
Let $m\ge2$ and $n\ge1$ be integers, let $\C_1,\dots,\C_{n+1}$ be categories, let 
$$
F_{i,j}:\C_j\to\C_{j+1},\quad1\le i\le m,\ 1\le j\le n
$$
be functors, let 
$$
\theta_{i,j}:F_{i,j}\to F_{i+1,j},\quad1\le i\le m-1,\ 1\le j\le n
$$
be functorial morphisms, and let $X$ be an object of $\C_1$. For $i\in M^n$, where $M:=\{1,2,\dots,m\}$, put 
$$
X_i:=F_{i_n,n}\cdots F_{i_1,1}X\in\C_{n+1},
$$
for $1\le p\le n$ set 
$$
e_p:=(0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0)\in M^n,
$$
the one being in the $p$-th position. Assuming $i,i+e_p\in M^n$, define the morphism 
$$
f_{i,p}:X_i\to X_{i+e_p}
$$
in $\C_{n+1}$ by 
$$
f_{i,p}:=(F_{i_n,n}\cdots F_{i_{p+1},p+1})(\theta_{i_p,p}(F_{i_{p-1},p-1}\cdots F_{i_1,1}X)).
$$

This gives rise to a diagram in $\C_{n+1}$ whose vertices are the $X_i$ with $i\in M^n$, and whose arrows are the $f_{i,p}$ with $i,i+e_p\in M^n$.

The first statement is that all the squares in this diagram commute, implying that the whole diagram commutes. In particular, all the paths from $X_{(1,\dots,1)}$ to $X_{(m,\dots,m)}$ coincide. (Such paths obviously exist.) So, we get a well-defined morphism in $\C_{n+1}$
$$
X_{(1,\dots,1)}=F_{1,n}\cdots F_{1,1}X\to F_{m,n}\cdots F_{m,1}X=X_{(m,\dots,m)}.
$$

The second statement is that this process defines a functorial morphism 
$$
F_{1,n}\cdots F_{1,1}\to F_{m,n}\cdots F_{m,1}.
$$

These two statements are easy to prove, and yield 

\n$\bu$ the definition of the vertical composition, for $m=3,\ n=1$,

\n$\bu$ the definition of the horizontal composition, for $m=n=2$,

\n$\bu$ the associativity of the vertical composition, for $m=4,\ n=1$,

\n$\bu$ the associativity of the the horizontal composition, for $m=2,\ n=3$,

\n$\bu$ the so-called \emph{Interchange Law}, for $m=3,\ n=2$.
%
\section{Equalities (1.5.8) and (1.5.9) (p. 29)}%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Warning: many authors designate $\e$ by $\eta$ and $\eta$ by $\e$. 

Denoting vertical composition by $\circ$ and horizontal composition by $*$, Equalities (1.5.8) and (1.5.9) read as follows: 
$$
(\eta*L)\circ(L*\e)=L,\quad (R*\eta)\circ(\e*R)=R.
$$ 

For the reader's convenience we prove these equalities. Let us denote by 
\begin{equation}\label{bij1}
\theta_{X,X'}:\Hom_\C(X,RX')\overset\sim\to\Hom_{\C'}(LX,X')
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{bij2}
\lambda_{X,X'}:\Hom_{\C'}(LX,X')\overset\sim\to\Hom_\C(X,RX')
\end{equation}
the functorial bijections defining the adjunction. 

To prove Equality (1.5.8), which can be written as 
$$
\eta_{LX}\circ L(\e_X)=\id_{LX},
$$
we view (\ref{bij1}) as a bijection functorial in $X\in\C$ (with $X'\in\C'$ fixed), we apply it to the morphism 
$$
\e_X:X\to RLX
$$ 
in $\C$, and then we replace $X'$ with $LX$. We get 
$$
\theta_{RLX,LX}(f)\circ L(\e_X)=\theta_{X,LX}(f\circ\e_X)
$$
for all $f$ in $\Hom_\C(RLX,RLX)$. Taking for $f$ the identity of $RLX$ gives (1.5.8).

To prove Equality (1.5.9), which can be written as 
$$
R(\eta_{X'})\circ\e_{RX'}=\id_{RX'},
$$
we view (\ref{bij2}) as a bijection functorial in $X'\in\C'$, (with $X\in\C$ fixed), we apply it to the morphism 
$$
\eta_{X'}:LRX'\to X'
$$ 
in $\C'$, and then we replace $X$ with $RX'$. We get 
$$
R(\eta_{X'})\circ(\lambda_{RX',LRX'}(f))=\lambda_{RX',X'}(\eta_{X'}\circ f)
$$
for all $f$ in $\Hom_{\C'}(LRX',LRX')$. Taking for $f$ the identity of $LRX'$ gives (1.5.9).

\section{\pr\ 2.7.1 (p. 62)}\label{s271}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
{\em Comment 1.} Here is a less elegant but slightly more precise formulation: 

Let $\C$ be a small category, $\A$ a $\U$-category admitting small inductive limits, and $F:\C\to\A$ a functor. Then the functor $\hy_\C^\dagger F:\C^\wedge\to\A$ exists, commutes with small inductive limits and satisfies $\hy_\C^\dagger F\circ\hy_\C\simeq F$. Conversely, if two functors $G,H:\C^\wedge\rightrightarrows\A$ satisfy the following conditions: 

\n(a) there are isomorphisms $\begin{tikzcd}
G\circ\hy_\C\ar{r}{\lambda}[swap]{\sim}&F&H\circ\hy_\C\ar{l}{\sim}[swap]{\mu}\end{tikzcd}$, 

\n(b) $G$ and $H$ commute with small inductive limits with values in $\C$ ({\em i.e}, for any functor $\alpha:I\to\C$ with $I$ small, $G(\ic\alpha)\simeq\co\ (F\circ\alpha)$, and similarly for $H$), 

\n then there is a unique morphism $\theta:G\to H$ such that the horizontal composition $\theta*\hy_\C$ coincides with $\mu^{-1}\circ\lambda$. Moreover $\theta$ is an isomorphism. 

The uniqueness of $\theta$ follows from \pr\ 2.6.3 (i) p. 61. 

This point reappears on pp 133 and 140 of the book. 

\n{\em Comment 2.} Consider the diagram 
%
\begin{equation}\label{271b}
\begin{tikzcd}
\C\ar{r}{\hy_\C}\ar{dr}[swap]{F}&\C^\wedge\ar{d}{\widetilde F}&I\ar{l}[swap]{\alpha}\\
&\A,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation} 
% 
where $I$ is a small category and $\widetilde F$ is defined by 
$$
\widetilde F(A):=\coli_{X\in\C_A}F(X). 
$$
\cn I'll rewrite the proof of the fact that the natural morphism 
%
$$
\coli\widetilde F(\alpha)\to
\widetilde F\left(\coli\alpha\right) 
$$ 
% 
is an isomorphism. It suffices to check that the functor $G:\A\to\C^\wedge$ defined by 
$$
G(X')(X):=\Hom_{\A}(F(X),X').
$$ 
is right adjoint to $\widetilde F$. This results from the following computation: 
$$
\Hom_{\A}\left(\widetilde F(A),X'\right)=
\Hom_{\A}\left(\coli_{X\in\C_A}F(X),X'\right)\simeq 
\lim_{X\in\C_A}\Hom_{\A}(F(X),X')
$$
$$
=\lim_{X\in\C_A}G(X')(X)\simeq\Hom_{\C^\wedge}(A,G(X')), 
$$ 
the last isomorphism following from (\ref{263}) p. \pageref{263}.

\section{Beginning of Section 5.1 (p. 113)}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
We want to define the notions of coimage (denoted by $\Coim$) and image (denoted by $\Ima$) in a slightly more general way than in the book. To this end we start by defining these notions in a particular context in which they coincide. To avoid confusions we (temporarily) use the notation $\IM$ for these particular cases. The proof of the following lemma is obvious. 
%
\begin{lem}\label{imset} 
For any set theoretical map $g:U\to V$ we have natural bijections 
$$ 
\Coker(U\times_VU\pa U)\simeq\IM g\simeq\Ker(V\pa V\sqcup_UV),
$$ 
where $\IM g$ denotes the image of $g$. 
\end{lem} 

Let $\C$ be a $\U$-small category, and let us denote by $\hy:\C\to\C^\wedge$ and $\ky:\C\to\C^\vee$ the Yoneda embeddings. For any morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\C$ define $\IM\hy(f)\in\C^\wedge$ and $\IM\ky(f)\in\C^\vee$ by 
$$ 
(\IM\hy(f))(Z):=\IM\,\hy(f)_Z,\quad(\IM\ky(f))(Z):=\IM\,\ky(f)_Z 
$$ 
for any $Z$ in $\C$. 
%
\begin{defn} 
In the above setting, the {\em coimage} of $f$ is the object $\Coim f\in\C^\vee$ defined by 
$$ 
(\Coim f)(Z):=\h_{\C^\wedge}(\IM\hy(f),\hy(Z))
$$ 
for all $Z$ in $\C$, and the {\em image} of $f$ is the object $\Ima f\in\C^\wedge$ defined by 
$$ 
(\Ima f)(Z):=\h_{\C^\vee}(\ky(Z),\IM\ky(f)) 
$$ 
for all $Z$ in $\C$. 
\end{defn} 
%

In view of Lemma \ref{imset} we have 
$$ 
(\Coim f)(Z)\simeq\Ker\Big(\h_\C(X,Z)\pa\h_{\C^\wedge}\big(\hy(X)\times_{\hy(Y)}\hy(X),\hy(Z)\big)\Big), 
$$ 
$$ 
(\Ima f)(Z)\simeq\Ker\Big(\h_\C(Z,Y)\pa\h_{\C^\vee}\big(\ky(Z),\ky(Y)\sqcup_{\ky(X)}\ky(Y)\big)\Big). 
$$ 
This implies 
% 
\begin{prop}\label{coimim}
If $P:=X\times_YX$ exists in $\C$, then $\Coim f$ is naturally isomorphic to $\Coker(P\pa X)\in\C^\vee$. If $S:=Y\sqcup_XY$ exists in $\C$, then $\Ima f$ is naturally isomorphic to $\Ker(Y\pa S)\in\C^\wedge$. 
\end{prop} 
%  

In view of Lemma \ref{imset} and \pr\ \ref{coimim} we can replace the notation $\IM$ with $\Ima$ (or $\Coim$). The proof of the following proposition is obvious. 
% 
\begin{prop}\label{fun}
We have: 

$f\mapsto\Ima\hy(f)$ and $\Ima$ are functors from $\Mor(\C)$ to $\C^\wedge$, 

$f\mapsto\Ima\ky(f)$ and $\Coim$ are functors from $\Mor(\C)$ to $\C^\vee$. 
% 
\end{prop} 
% 
\section{Theorem 5.3.6 (p. 124)}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
As an exercise, I rewrite the proof. The difference between the rewriting and the original proof is very slight. Here is the statement of the theorem:\bigskip

\centerline *

\n Let $\C$ be a category satisfying the conditions (i)-(iii) below:

\n (i) $\C$ admits small inductive limits and finite projective limits, 

\n (ii) small filtrant inductive limits are stable by base change (see Definition 2.2.6 p. 47), 

\n (iii) any epimorphism is strict.

\n Let $\F$ be an essentially small full subcategory of $\C$ such that 

\n (a) $\Ob(\F)$ is a system of generators,

\n (b) $\F$ is closed by finite coproducts in $\C$. 

\n Then $\F$ is strictly generating.

\centerline *

\n Proof. We may assume from the beginning that $\F$ is small.

\n Step 1. By Proposition 5.2.3 (i) p. 118, the functor $\p$ in (5.3.1) p. 121 is conservative and faithful.

\n Step 2. By Proposition 1.2.12 p. 16, a morphism $f$ in $\C$ is an epimorphism as soon as $\p(f)$ is an epimorphism.

\n Step 3. Let us fix $X\in\C$, and let $\zeta:\C_X\to\C$ be the natural functor, so that an object of $\C_X$ consists of a morphism $z:\zeta(z)\to X$ in $\C$. Let $(z_i)_{i\in I}$ be a small filtrant inductive system in $\C_X$. We claim 
$$
\coli_i\Coim z_i\xrightarrow{\sim}
\Coim\left(\coli_i\zeta(z_i)\to X\right).
$$
\n Step 3'. Let $A$ be in $\F^\wedge$, and let $(B_i\to A)_{i\in I}$ be a small filtrant inductive system in $(\F^\wedge)_A$. We claim 
$$
\coli_i\Coim(B_i\to A)\xrightarrow{\sim}
\Coim\left(\coli_iB_i\to A\right).
$$
Step 4. We claim that there is a natural isomorphism 
$$\Hom_\C(\Coim z,Y)\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\Big(\Coim\p(z),\p(Y)\Big).
$$ 

\n Step 5. Let us denote by $I$ the set of finite subsets of $\Ob(\F_X)$, ordered by inclusion. Regarding $I$ as a category, it is small and filtrant. Let $\xi:I\to\F_X$ be the functor defined by letting $\xi(A)$ be the natural morphism $\bigsqcup_{z\in A}\zeta(z)\to X$. We claim that the natural morphism 
$$
\coli_{A\in I}\p\zeta\xi(A)\to\p(X) 
$$ 
is an epimorphism.

\n Step 6. We claim that there is a natural isomorphism 
$$
\coli_{A\in I}\Coim\xi(A)\simeq X. 
$$

These steps imply the theorem: Indeed, we have, in the above setting, 
%
\begin{align*} 
%
\Hom_\C(X,Y)&\simeq\Hom_\C\left(\coli_{A\in I}\Coim\xi(A),Y\right)&\text{by Step 6}\\ \\ 
%
&\simeq\lim_{A\in I}\Hom_\C(\Coim\xi(A),Y)\\ \\ 
% 
&\simeq\lim_{A\in I}\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\Big(\Coim\p\xi(A),\p(Y)\Big)&\text{by Step 4}\\ \\ 
%
&\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\left(\coli_{A\in I}\Coim\p\xi(A),\p(Y)\right)\\ \\ 
%
&\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\left(\Coim\left(\coli_{A\in I}\p\zeta\xi(A)\to\p(X)\right),\p(Y)\right)&\text{by Step 3'}\\ \\ 
%
&\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}(\p(X),\p(Y))&\text{by Step 5.}
%
\end{align*} 
%

It remains to prove Steps 3, 3', 4, 5, 6. We refer to [KS] for Step 3. The proof of Step 3' is the same. (It is easy to see that small inductive limits in $\F^\wedge$ are stable by base change.) 

\n Proof of Step 4. We have 
$$
\Hom_\C(\Coim z,Y)\simeq\Hom_\C\big(\Coker(Z\times_XZ\rightrightarrows Z),Y\big)
$$
$$
\simeq\Ker\big(\Hom_\C(Z,Y)\rightrightarrows\Hom_\C(Z\times_XZ,Y)\big),
$$ 
and also $\Hom_\C(Z,Y)\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}(\p(Z),\p(Y))$ by the Yoneda Lemma. As $\p$ is faithful, we have an injection 
$$
\Hom_\C(Z\times_XZ,Y)\mono\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\big(\p(Z\times_XZ),\p(Y)\big)
$$
$$
\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\big(\p(Z)\times_{\p(X)}\p(Z),\p(Y)\big).
$$ 
This yields 
$$
\Hom_\C(\Coim z,Y)
$$
$$
\simeq\Ker\Big(\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\big(\p(Z),\p(Y)\big)\rightrightarrows\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\big(\p(Z)\times_{\p(X)}\p(Z),\p(Y)\big)\Big)
$$
$$
\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}\Big(\Coker\big(\p(Z)\times_{\p(X)}\p(Z)\rightrightarrows\p(Z)\big),\p(Y)\Big)
$$
$$
\simeq\Hom_{\F^\wedge}(\Coim\p(z),\p(Y)).
$$
Proof of Step 5. Let $Z$ be in $\F$. We must show that the natural map 
$$
\coli_{A\in I}\ (\p\zeta\xi(A))(Z)\to\p(X)(Z):=\Hom_\C(Z,X) 
$$
is surjective. Let $z$ be in $\Hom_\C(Z,X)$. It suffices to check that $z$ is in the image of the natural map 
$$
(\p\zeta\xi(\{z\}))(Z)=\Hom_\C(Z,Z)\xrightarrow{z\circ}\Hom_\C(Z,X),
$$
which is obvious. 

\n Proof of Step 6. Let 
$$
\coli_{A\in I}\p\zeta\xi(A)\xrightarrow{b}\p\left(\coli_{A\in I}\zeta\xi(A)\right)\xrightarrow{a}\p(X)
$$
be the natural morphisms. As $a\circ b$ is an epimorphism by Step 5, $a$ is an epimorphism. By Step 2, 
$$
\coli_{A\in I}\zeta\xi(A)\to X
$$ 
is also an epimorphism, hence a strict epimorphism. We have 
$$
\coli_{A\in I}\Coim\xi(A)\simeq\Coim\left(\coli_{A\in I}\zeta\xi(A)\to X\right)\simeq X.
$$ 
Indeed, the first isomorphism follows from Step 3, and the second one from Proposition 5.5 (i) p. 115. 
%
\section{Proposition 6.1.9 (p. 133)}\label{619}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The following point is implicit in [KS], and we give additional details for the reader's convenience. Proposition 6.1.9 results immediately from the statement below:

In the setting of Proposition 6.1.9, let $\C\overset{i}{\to}\Ind(\C)\overset{j}{\to}\C^\wedge$ be the natural functors, let $\A$ be a category which admits small filtrant inductive limit, and let $F:\C\to\A$ be a functor. Then the functor $i^\dagger(F):\Ind(\C)\to\A$ exists, commutes with small filtrant inductive limits, and satisfies $i^\dagger(F)\circ i\simeq F$. Conversely, any functor $\widetilde F:\Ind(\C)\to\A$ commuting with small filtrant inductive limits with values in $\C$, and satisfying $\widetilde F\circ i\simeq F$ is isomorphic to $i^\dagger(F)$. 

The proof is essentially the same that that of Proposition 2.7.1 on p. 62 of [KS]. (See also Comment~1 in Section \ref{s271} p. \pageref{s271}) and (\ref{271b}) p. \pageref{271b}.) Again, we give some more details about the proof of the fact that $i^\dagger(F)$ commutes with small filtrant inductive limits. Put $\widetilde F:=i^\dagger(F)$. 

Let us attach the functor $\Hom_\A(F(\ ),Y)\in\C^\wedge$ to the object $Y\in\A$. To apply Observation (\ref{2.1.10}) p. \pageref{2.1.10} to the diagram 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
I\ar{r}{\alpha}&\Ind(\C)\ar{d}[swap]{j}\ar{r}{\widetilde F}&\A\\
&\C^\wedge,
\end{tikzcd}
$$
it suffices to check that there is an isomorphism 
$$
\Hom_\A\left(\widetilde F(\ ),Y\right)\simeq
\Hom_{\C^\wedge}(\ \ ,B)
$$ 
in $\Ind(\C)^\wedge$. Using the notation in \eqref{convnot} p. \pageref{convnot}, we have 
$$
\widetilde F(A):=\coli_{X\in\C_A}F(X),
$$ 
as well as the following isomorphisms functorial in $A\in\C^\wedge$:
$$
\Hom_\A\left(\widetilde F(A),Y\right)=
\Hom_\A\left(\coli_{X\in\C_A}F(X),Y\right)\simeq
\lim_{X\in\C_A}B(X)
$$
$$
\simeq
\lim_{X\in\C_A}\Hom_{\C^\wedge}((j\circ i)(X),B)
\simeq
\Hom_{\C^\wedge}\left(\icolim_{X\in\C_A}X,B\right)\simeq
\Hom_{\C^\wedge}(j(A),B).
$$

\section{\pr\ 6.1.12 (p. 134)}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
We give some more details about the proof. Recall the setting: 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\Ind(\C_1\times\C_2)\ar[yshift=0.7ex]{r}{\theta}&\Ind(\C_1)\times\Ind(\C_2).\ar[yshift=-0.7ex]{l}{\mu}
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 

We shall define $\theta$ and $\mu$ and prove that they are quasi-inverse equivalences. But first let us introduce some notation. We shall consider functors 
$$
A\in\Ind(\C_1\times\C_2);\quad A_i,B_i\in\Ind(\C_i), 
$$ 
objects $X_i,Y_i,\dots\in\C_i$, and elements 
$$
x\in A(X_1,X_2),y\in A(Y_1,Y_2),\dots,\quad x_i\in A_i(X_i),y_i\in A_i(Y_i),\dots
$$ 
When we write 
$$
\co_x\ \cdots,\quad \co_{x_i}\ \cdots,\quad \co_{x_1,x_2}\ \cdots,
$$ 
we mean, in the first case, not only that $x$ runs over the elements of $A(X_1,X_2)$, but also that $X_1$ and $X_2$ themselves run over the objects of $\C_1$ and $\C_2$, so that we are taking the inductive limit of some functor defined over $(\C_1\times\C_2)_A$. In the other cases, the interpretation is similar. 

Now recall the definition of $\theta$ and $\mu$: The functor $\theta$ is defined by $\theta(A)=(A_1,A_2)$ with 
$$
A_i:=\ic_x\ X_i. 
$$ 
The functor $\mu$ is defined by 
$$
\mu(A_1,A_2):=\ic_{x_1,x_2}\ (X_1,X_2). 
$$ 

Now we prove that $\theta$ and $\mu$ are mutually quasi-inverse. 

By the IPC Property (see pp 75-77 of the book), we have 
$$
\mu(A_1,A_2)(X_1,X_2)\simeq A_1(X_1)\times A_2(X_2), 
$$ 
which suggests the notation $A_1\times A_2$ for $\mu(A_1,A_2)$. 

Let $A_i$ be in $\Ind(\C_i)$ for $i=1,2$, let $A$ be $A_1\times A_2$, and let $(B_1,B_2)$ be $\theta(A)$. Then we have 
$$ 
B_1\simeq\ic_x\ X_1\simeq\ic_{x_1,x_2}\ X_1\simeq\ic_{x_1}\ X_1\simeq A_1.
$$ 
Indeed, the third isomorphism follows from the fact that the projection 
$$
(\C_1)_{A_1}\times (\C_2)_{A_2}\to(\C_1)_{A_1}
$$ 
is cofinal because $(\C_1)_{A_1}$ is nonempty and $(\C_2)_{A_2}$ is connected. 

Let $A$ be in $\Ind(\C_1\times\C_2)$ and set $(A_1,A_2):=\theta(A)$. We shall define morphisms $A\to A_1\times A_2$ and $A_1\times A_2\to A$, and leave it to the reader to check that these morphisms are mutually inverse functorial isomorphisms. 

Definition of the morphism $A\to A_1\times A_2$: Recall 
$$
A\simeq\ic_y\ (Y_1,Y_2), 
$$ 
and let $y$ be in $A(Y_1,Y_2)$. We must define $y_i\in A_i(Y_1),i=1,2$. Recall 
$$
A_i(Y_i)\simeq\co_x\ \h_{\C_i}(Y_i,X_i), 
$$ 
let $a_i(x):\h_{\C_i}(Y_i,X_i)\to A_i(Y_i)$ be the coprojection, and put 
$$
y_i:=a_i(y)(\id_{Y_i}). 
$$ 

Definition of the morphism $A_1\times A_2\to A$: Recall 
$$
A_1\times A_2\simeq\ic_{x_1,x_2}\ (X_1,X_2). 
$$ 
Let $x_i$ be in $A_i(X_i)$. We must define $x\in A(X_1,X_2)$. We have 
$$
A_i(X_i)\simeq\co_y\ \h_{\C_i}(X_i,Y_i). 
$$ 
Let $b_i(y):\h_{\C_i}(X_i,Y_i)\to A_i(X_i)$ be the coprojection. The categories $(\C_i)_{A_i}$ being filtrant, there is a 5-tuple $(Y_1,Y_2,y,f_1,f_2)$ with $Y_i$ in $\C_i$, $y$ in $A(Y_1,Y_2)$, and $f_i$ in $\h_{\C_i}(X_i,Y_i)$ such that $x_i=b_i(y)(f_i)$ for $i=1,2$. We put $x:=A(f_1,f_2)(y)$, and leave it to the reader to check that $x$ does not depend on the choices made above.

\section{Exercise 6.11 (p. 147)}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
(This exercise is used on p. 197 in the proof of Proposition 8.6.12.) Write $F$ for the inclusion of $\J$ in $\C$. As observed at the end of the comment about pages 63 and 133, $A$ is isomorphic to $IF(B)$ for some $B$ in $\Ind(\J)$ if and only if $A\circ F$ is in $\Ind(\J)$. Proposition 6.1.5 p. 132 implies that $\C_A$ is filtrant and cofinally small, and that $A\circ F$ is in $\Ind(\J)$ if and only if $\J_{A\circ F}$ is filtrant and cofinally small. As $\J_{A\circ F}$ is canonically isomorphic to $\J_A$ by the Yoneda Lemma, we may identify these two categories. 

Assume that the factorization condition in Exercise 6.11 holds. We must check that $\J_A$ is filtrant and cofinally small. Proposition 3.2.4 p. 79 implies that $\J_A$ is filtrant. Let $J$ be a small full subcategory of $\C_A$ cofinal to $\C_A$, and define the full subcategory $I$ of $\J_A$ as follows. For each $j$ in $J$ pick a morphism $j\to i_j$ with $i_j\in I$, and let the objects of $I$ be the $i_j$. Then $I$ is small and cofinal to $I$. 

\n Conversely, let $\J_A$ be filtrant and cofinally small. (Recall that $\J_A$ and $\J_{A\circ F}$ are identified.) Proposition 2.7.2 p. 62 implies that the diagram
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\J_A\ar{r}{\p}\ar{d}[swap]{k_{A\circ F}}&
\C_A\ar{d}{k_A}
\\
\J^\wedge\ar{r}[swap]{\widehat F}&\C^\wedge,
\end{tikzcd}
$$
where the functors are the obvious ones, commutes up to isomorphism, and that the canonical morphism 
$$
\coli\ k_A\circ\p\to\coli k_A
$$
is an isomorphism. Assume by contradiction that there is an object $Y_0$ of $\C$ and a morphism $Y_0\overset{y_0}{\to}A$ in $\C^\wedge$ which does \emph{not} factor through any object of $\J$. Put 
$$
P:=\left(\coli\ k_A\circ\p\right)(Y_0)=\coli_{(X\overset{x}{\to}A)\in\J_A}\Hom_\C(Y_0,X),
$$
$$
Q:=\left(\coli\ k_A\right)(Y_0)=\coli_{(Y\overset{y}{\to}A)\in\C_A}\Hom_\C(Y_0,Y),
$$
let $\phi:P\to Q$ be the natural map, which is bijective by hypothesis, and let 
$$
p(X\overset{x}{\to}A):\Hom_\C(Y_0,X)\to P,\quad q(Y\overset{y}{\to}A):\Hom_\C(Y_0,Y)\to Q
$$
be the canonical maps. Then $\phi$ is characterized by 
$$
\phi(p(X\overset{x}{\to}A)(Y_0\overset{a}{\to}X))=q(Y\overset{y}{\to}A)(Y_0\overset{a}{\to}X)
$$
for all object $X\overset{x}{\to}A$ of $\J_A$ and all $\C$-morphism $Y_0\overset{a}{\to}X$. As $\phi$ is surjective, there is an $X\overset{x}{\to}A$ in $\J_A$ and a $\C$-morphism $Y_0\overset{a}{\to}X$ such that 
$$
q(X\overset{x}{\to}A)(Y_0\overset{a}{\to}X)=q(Y_0\overset{y_0\ }{\to}A)(\id_{Y_0}).
$$
By Proposition 3.1.3 p. 73, we can find an object $Z\overset{z}{\to}A$ of $\C_A$ and $\C_A$-morphisms 
$$
(X\overset{x}{\to}A)\to(Z\overset{z}{\to}A)\leftarrow(Y_0\overset{y_0\ }{\to}A)
$$
induced by $\C$-morphisms 
$$
X\overset{b}{\to}Z\overset{c}{\leftarrow}Y_0
$$
such that $b\circ a=c$. We get the diagram 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
Y_0\ar{rr}{a}\ar{dr}{c}\ar{ddr}[swap]{y_0}&&X\ar{dl}[swap]{b}\ar{ddl}{x}\\
&Z\ar{d}[swap]{z}&\\
&A.
\end{tikzcd}
$$
As the three small triangle commute, so does the big one, contradicting the choice of $Y_0\overset{y_0\ }{\to}A$.

\section{Proof of (7.4.3) (p. 162)}%%%%%%%%%%
%
(I think it is fine to leave such a proof to the reader, but since I wrote it for myself, I thought I might paste it here.)

Let us abbreviate $\text{Ind}(\C)$ and $\text{Ind}(\A)$ by $I\C$ and $I\A$. We have the (non-commutative) diagram
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\C\ar{rr}{F}\ar{d}[swap]{s}\ar{dr}{\iota_\C}&&\A\ar{d}{\iota_\A}\\ 
\C_\SSS\ar{r}[swap]{\alpha_\SSS}&I\C\ar{r}[swap]{IF}&I\A.
\end{tikzcd}
$$
Reminders:

\n$*$ The definition of $IF$ p. 133 implies
$$
IF(A)=\coli_{U\in\C_A}\iota_\A(F(U))\in I\A.
$$ 
\cn

\n $*$ Display (7.3.7) p. 161 implies
$$
B:=R_\SSS(\iota_\A\circ F)(Q(X))=\coli_{(X\to X')\in\SSS^X}\iota_\A(F(X'))\in I\A.
$$
$*$ Proposition 7.4.1 p. 162 implies
$$
A:=\alpha_\SSS(Q(X))=\coli_{(X\to X')\in\SSS^X}\iota_\C(X')\in I\C.
$$
We want to prove 
$$
B\simeq IF(A).
$$

Definition of a morphism 
\begin{tikzcd}
B\ar[dashed]{r}&IF(A)
\end{tikzcd}: 
Let $(X\to X')\in\SSS^X$ be given. It suffices to define 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
\iota_\A(F(X'))\ar[dashed]{r}&IF(A)
\end{tikzcd}.
$$ 
Form the canonical morphism $\iota_\C(X')\to A$ attached to $(X\to X')\in\SSS^X$, and then the canonical morphism $\iota_\A(F(X'))\to IF(A)$ attached to $\iota_\C(X')\to A$. 

Definition of a morphism 
$\begin{tikzcd}
IF(A)\ar[dashed]{r}&B
\end{tikzcd}$: Let $(\iota_\C(U)\to A)\in\C_A$ be given. It suffices to define 
$\begin{tikzcd}
\iota_\A(F(U))\ar[dashed]{r}&B
\end{tikzcd}$. 
We define it as the canonical morphism attached to the identity of $U$ viewed as an object of $\SSS^X$.

We leave it to the reader to check that these two morphisms are mutually inverse.

\section{Beginning of Section 8.2 (p. 169)} \label{169}%%%%%%%
% 
Here is a minor variant. (As usual, I am not claiming that it is better.) (See also \ccd\ \eqref{173} p. \pageref{173}.) 

Let $\C$ be a category. Say that the objects $X_1$ and $X_2$ of $\C$ satisfy Condition~$(\oplus)$ if the following holds: 

\n(a) There is an object $X=X_1\oplus X_2$ of $\C$, and there are morphisms $X_j\xr{i_j}X\xr{p_j}X_j$ for $j=1,2$ such that $X$ is a product of $X_1$ and $X_2$ by $p_1$ and $p_2$ and a coproduct of $X_1$ and $X_2$ by $i_1$ and $i_2$, 

\n(b) $p_j\circ i_j=\id_{X_j}$ for $j=1,2$. 

Lemma 8.2.3 (i) p. 169 can be phrased as follows: 

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be objects of a pre-additive category $\C$. If $X_1\times X_2$ exists in $\C$, then $X_1$ and $X_2$ of $\C$ satisfy $(\oplus)$ with $X=X_1\times X_2$. Moreover we have $p_j\circ i_k=0$ for $j\neq k$ and $i_1\circ p_1+i_2\circ p_2=\id_X$. 

We can define an additive category as follows: An additive category is a category $\C$ satisfying the conditions below: 

\n(i) $\C$ has a zero object, denoted by 0, 

\n(ii) Condition $(\oplus)$ holds for any $X_1,X_2\in\C$. Moreover we have, in the above notation, $p_j\circ i_k=0$ for $j\neq k$, 

\n(iii) for any $X\in\C$ there is an $a$ in $\h_\C(X,X)$ such that the composition 
$$ 
X\xr{\delta_X}X\oplus X\xr{\id_X\oplus a}X\oplus X\xr{\sigma_X}X 
$$ 
is the zero morphism. Here, $\delta_X$ is the diagonal morphism and $\sigma_X$ is the codiagonal morphism. 

If $\C$ is an additive category and $X$ an object of $\C$, then the morphisms 
% 
\be\label{soa} 
\sigma_X:X\oplus X\to X,\quad0:X\to X,\quad a:X\to X 
\ee 
%
turn $X$ into an abelian group object. 

Let $\C$ be an additive category, let $U:\Mod(\mathbb Z)^\C\to\Set^\C$ be the forgetful functor, let $F,G\in\Set^\C$ be functors commuting with finite products, and let $\theta:F\to G$ be a functorial morphism. We shall define a morphism $\widetilde\theta:\widetilde F\to\widetilde G$ in $\Mod(\mathbb Z)^\C$ such that 
$$ 
U(\widetilde F)=F,\quad U(\widetilde G)=G,\quad U(\widetilde\theta)=\theta. 
$$ 
To this end, we define $U(\widetilde F)(X)$ as being the set $F(X)$ equipped with the abelian group structure obtained by applying $F$ to \eqref{soa}. We handle $G$ similarly. By Lemma 8.2.11 p. 172 of the book, $\theta_X:F(X)\to G(X)$ is a morphism of abelian groups, that is, we can define $U(\widetilde\theta)_X$ as being $\theta_X$. 

In the notation of the proof of Theorem 8.2.14 p. 173, we apply the above observation to the functorial morphism 
$$ 
\circ h:\h_\C(X,\cdot)\to\h_\C(W,\cdot). 
$$ 
(The only difference with the book is that, in \pr\ 8.2.13 p. 173, instead of defining $\widetilde F$ by a property which makes it unique up to unique isomorphism, we define it explicitly.) 
%
\section{The complex (8.3.3) (p. 178)}%%%%%%%%%%
%
Let me just add a few more details about the proof of the isomorphisms
\begin{equation}\label{834}
\begin{split}
\Ima u\simeq\Coker(\p:\Ima f\to\Ker g)\simeq\Coker(X'\to\Ker g)\\ 
\simeq\Ker(\psi:\Coker f\to\Ima g)\simeq\Ker(\Coker f\to X''),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
labeled (8.3.4) in [KS]. Recall that the underlying category $\C$ is abelian, and that the complex in question is denoted $X'\xrightarrow{f}X\xrightarrow{g}X''$. We shall freely use the isomorphism between image and coimage, as well as the abbreviations 
$$
K_v:=\Ker v,\quad C_v:=\Coker v,\quad I_v:=\Ima v.
$$ 
Let us also write ``$A\overset{\sim}{\to}B$'' for ``the natural morphism $A\to B$ is an isomorphism''. 

Proposition 8.3.4 p. 176 can be stated as follows. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism, and consider the commutative diagram 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
K_f\ar[tail]{rr}{h}&&X\ar{rr}{f}\ar[two heads]{dl}\ar[two heads]{dr}&&Y\ar[two heads]{rr}{k}&&C_f\\ 
&C_h\ar{rr}&&I_f\ar[tail]{ur}\ar{rr}&&K_k.\ar[tail]{ul}
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
Then the bottom arrows are isomorphisms.  

Going back to our complex $X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''$, let us introduce the notation 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
X'\ar{rrr}{f}\ar[equal]{d}&&&X\ar[equal]{d}\ar{rrr}{g}&&&X''\ar[equal]{d}\\ 
X'\ar[two heads]{r}{a}&I_f\ar[tail]{r}{\p}&K_g\ar[equal]{d}\ar[tail]{r}{b}&X\ar[two heads]{r}{c}&C_f\ar[equal]{d}\ar[two heads]{r}{\psi}&I_g\ar[tail]{r}{d}&X''\\ 
K_u\ar[tail]{rr}{e}&&K_g\ar[two heads]{dl}\ar[two heads]{dr}\ar{rr}{u}&&C_f\ar[two heads]{rr}{h}&&C_u\\ 
&C_e\ar{rr}{\sim}[swap]{i}&&I_u\ar[tail]{ur}\ar{rr}{\sim}[swap]{j}&&K_h.\ar[tail]{ul}
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
The fact that $i$ and $j$ are isomorphisms follows from the previous paragraph. 

We shall prove 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
C_{\p\circ a}\ar{r}{k}[swap]{\sim}&C_\p\ar{r}{\ell}[swap]{\sim}&C_e\ar{r}{i}[swap]{\sim}&I_u\ar{r}{j}[swap]{\sim}&K_h\ar{r}{m}[swap]{\sim}&K_\psi\ar{r}{n}[swap]{\sim}&K_{d\circ\psi}.
\end{tikzcd}
$$
This will imply (\ref{834}). We already know that $i$ and $j$ are isomorphisms. Moreover, $k$ and $n$ are isomorphisms because $a$ is an epimorphism and $d$ a monomorphism. It is easy to see that there are natural morphisms $I_f\mono K_u\mono K_c$. As observed in \ccd\ \eqref{176a} p. \pageref{176a}, the composition $I_f\to K_c$ is an isomorphism. This implies $I_f\xr\sim K_u$. Similarly we prove $C_u\xr\sim I_g$, so that we can complete our previous diagram as follows: 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
X'\ar{rrr}{f}\ar[equal]{d}&&&X\ar[equal]{d}\ar{rrr}{g}&&&X''\ar[equal]{d}\\ 
X'\ar[two heads]{r}{a}&I_f\ar[dashed]{dl}[swap]{\sim}\ar[tail]{r}{\p}&K_g\ar[equal]{d}\ar[tail]{r}{b}&X\ar[two heads]{r}{c}&C_f\ar[equal]{d}\ar[two heads]{r}{\psi}&I_g\ar[tail]{r}{d}&X''\\ 
K_u\ar[tail]{rr}{e}&&K_g\ar[two heads]{dl}\ar[two heads]{dr}\ar{rr}{u}&&C_f\ar[two heads]{rr}{h}&&C_u\ar[dashed]{ul}[swap]{\sim}\\ 
&C_e\ar{rr}{\sim}[swap]{i}&&I_u\ar[tail]{ur}\ar{rr}{\sim}[swap]{j}&&K_h.\ar[tail]{ul}
\end{tikzcd}
$$ 
(The two dashed arrows have been added.) Now the fact that $\ell$ and $m$ are isomorphisms is clear. 
%
\section{Exercise 8.17 (p. 204)}\label{817} 
%
Let us denote the cokernel of any morphism $h:Y\to Z$ in any abelian category by $Z/\Ima h$. 

(i) By Proposition 8.3.18 p. 183, an additive functor between abelian categories $F:\C\to\C'$ is left exact if and only if 
\begin{equation}\label{sex1}
\left.
\begin{matrix}
0\to X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''\text{ exact }\\ 
\implies\\ 
0\to F(X')\overset{F(f)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X)\overset{F(g)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X'')\text{ exact}
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation} 
Consider the condition 
\begin{equation}\label{sex2}
\left.
\begin{matrix}
0\to X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''\to0\text{ exact }\\ 
\implies\\ 
0\to F(X')\overset{F(f)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X)\overset{F(g)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X'')\text{ exact}
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation}
We must show (\ref{sex1}) $\iff$ (\ref{sex2}). The implication $\implies$ is clear. To prove $\Longleftarrow$, let 
$$
0\to X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''
$$
be exact, let $I$ be the image of $g$, and observe that $0\to I\to X''\to X''/I\to0$ and $0\to X'\to X\to I\to0$ are exact. Now the exactness of $0\to F(I)\to F(X'')$ and $0\to F(X')\to F(X)\to F(I)$ implies that of $0\to F(X')\to F(X)\to F(X'')$. 

(ii) The only nontrivial statement is the following one. Consider the conditions below on our additive functor $F:\C\to\C'$: 
\begin{equation}\label{ex1}
\left.
\begin{matrix}
0\to X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''\to0\text{ exact }\\ 
\implies\\ 
0\to F(X')\overset{F(f)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X)\overset{F(g)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X'')\to0\text{ exact}
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation}  
\begin{equation}\label{ex2}
\left.
\begin{matrix}
X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''\text{ exact }\\ 
\implies\\ 
F(X')\overset{F(f)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X)\overset{F(g)\ }{\longrightarrow}F(X'')\text{ exact}
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation} 
Then (\ref{ex1}) implies (\ref{ex2}). To prove this, let 
$$
X'\overset{f}{\to}X\overset{g}{\to}X''
$$
be exact; let $K_g,K_f$ and $I_g$ denote the indicated kernels and image; and observe that the sequences 
$$
0\to K_f\to X'\to K_g\to 0,
$$
$$
0\to K_g\to X\to I_g\to 0,
$$
$$
0\to I_g\to X''\to X''/I_g\to 0
$$
are exact. Now the exactness of 
$$
F(X')\to F(K_g)\to0,\quad 0\to F(I_g)\to F(X''),\quad F(K_g)\to F(X)\to F(I_g)
$$
implies that of $F(X')\to F(X)\to F(X'')$.

where the first two rows and columns are distinguished triangles, and we must prove that the dotted arrows may be completed in order that the bottom right small square anti-commutes, the eight other small squares commute, and all rows and columns are distinguished triangles.

We define $X^2\to Y^2$ as the composition $X^2\to W\to Y^2$, and $Z^0\to Z^1$ as the composition $Z^0\to W\to Z^1$. From

anti-commutes, that the eight other small squares commute, and that all rows and columns are distinguished triangles.

We list the nine small squares of each of the diagrams (\ref{v1}), (\ref{v2}), (\ref{v3}), (\ref{v4}) as follows:
$$
\begin{matrix}1&2&3\\ 4&5&6\\ 7&8&9
\end{matrix}
$$ 
and we denote the $j$-th small square of Diagram $(i)$ by $(i)j$. 

The commutativity of (\ref{v1})2 and (\ref{v2})5 implies that of (\ref{v4})2. 

The commutativity of (\ref{v1})3 and (\ref{v2})6 implies that of (\ref{v4})3.

The commutativity of (\ref{v2})7 and (\ref{v3})1 implies that of (\ref{v4})4.

The commutativity of (\ref{v2})8 and (\ref{v3})2 implies that of (\ref{v4})5. 

The commutativity of (\ref{v2})9 and (\ref{v3})3 implies that of (\ref{v4})6. 

The commutativity of (\ref{v2})3 and (\ref{v1})6 implies that of (\ref{v4})7. 

The commutativity of (\ref{v1})9 and (\ref{v3})8 implies that of (\ref{v4})8. 

The commutativity of (\ref{v3})6 and (\ref{v1})3 implies the anti-commutativity of (\ref{v4})9. 

It is easy to check that all rows and columns are distinguished triangles.

As observed by Peter May in \emph{The axioms for triangulated categories}, the above proof shows that TR4 follows from the other axioms.
