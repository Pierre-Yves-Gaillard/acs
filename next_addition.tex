\section{Brief comments} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%
\n$\bu$ P. 80. [This comment has already been incorporated into the main text.] \pr s 3.2.4 and 3.2.6 can be combined as follows. 

\begin{prop}\label{comb} 
Let $\p:J\to I$ be fully faithful. Assume that $I$ is filtrant and cofinally small, and that for each $i$ in $I$ there is a morphism $i\to\p(j)$ for some $j$ in $J$. Then $\p$ is cofinal and $J$ is filtrant and cofinally small. 
\end{prop} 

\n{\em Proof.} In view of \pr\ 3.2.4 it suffices to show that $J$ is cofinally small. By \pr\ 3.2.6, there is a small full subcategory $S\subset I$ cofinal to $I$. For each $s$ in $S$ pick a morphism $s\to\p(j_s)$ with $j_s\in J$. Then, for each $j$ in $J$ there are morphisms $\p(j)\to s\to\p(j_s)$ with $s$ in $S$. As $\p$ is full there is a morphism $j\to j_s$, and we conclude by using again \pr\ 3.2.6.

\n$\bu$ P. 147, Exercise 6.11. \rw\ We prove the following slightly more general statement: 
% 
\begin{prop}
%
Let $F:\cc C\to\cc C'$ be a functor, let $A'$ be in $\Ind(\cc C')$, and let $S$ be the set of objects $A$ of $\Ind(\cc C)$ such that $IF(A)\simeq A'$. Then the following conditions are equivalent: 

\n{\em(a)} $S\neq\varnothing$, 

\n{\em(b)} all morphism $X'\to A'$ in $\Ind(\cc C')$ with $X'$ in $\cc C'$ factorizes through $F(X)$ for some $X$ in $\cc C$, 

\n{\em(c)} the natural functor $\cc C_{A'\circ F}\to\cc C'_{A'}$ is cofinal, 

\n{\em(d)} $A'\circ F\in S$.
%
\end{prop}
%
[The proof (given in the main text) is not reproduced here.]

\n$\bu$ P. 177, Definition 8.3.5. The following definitions and observations are implicit in the book. Let $\cc A$ be a subcategory of a pre-additive category $\cc B$, and let $\iota:\cc A\to \cc B$ be the inclusion. If $\cc A$ is pre-additive and $\iota$ is additive, we say that $\cc A$ is a {\em pre-additive subcategory} of $\cc B$. If in addition $\cc A$ and $\cc B$ are additive (resp. abelian), we say that $\cc A$ is {\em an additive (resp. abelian) subcategory} of $\cc B$. Now let $\cc A$ and $\cc B$ be categories. If $\cc B$ is pre-additive (resp. additive, abelian), then so is the category $\cc C:=\cc B^\cc A$ of functors from $\cc A$ to $\cc B$. Assume in addition that $\cc A$ is pre-additive. If $\cc B$ is pre-additive (resp. additive, abelian), then the full subcategory $\cc D:=\Ad(\cc A,\cc B)$ of $\cc C$ whose objects are the additive functors from $\cc A$ to $\cc B$ is a pre-additive (resp. additive, abelian) subcategory of $\cc C$.

\n$\bu$ P. 186, Definition 8.3.24 (definition of a Grothendieck category). The condition that small filtrant inductive limits are exact is not automatic. I know no entirely elementary proof of this important fact. Here is a proof using a little bit of sheaf theory. To show that there is an abelian category where small filtrant inductive limits exist but are not exact, it suffices to prove that there is an abelian category $\C$ where small filtrant {\em projective} limits exist but are not exact. It is even enough to show that small products are not exact in $\C$. Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $U_0\supset U_1\supset\cdots$ be a decreasing sequence of open subsets whose intersection is a non-open closed singleton $\{a\}$. We can take for $\C$ the category of small abelian sheaves on $X$. To see this, let $G$ be the abelian presheaf over $X$ such that $G(U)$ is $\mathbb Z$ if $a\in U$ and 0 otherwise, and, for each $n\in\mathbb N$, let $F_n$ be the abelian presheaf over $X$ such that $F_n(U)$ is $\mathbb Z$ if $U\subset U_n$ and 0 otherwise. These presheaves are easily seen to be sheaves. For each $n\in\mathbb N$ and each open set $U$ let $F_n(U)\to G(U)$ be the identity if $a\in U\subset U_n$ and 0 otherwise. This family of morphisms define, when $U$ varies, an epimorphism $\p_n:F_n\epi G$. Put 
$$
F:=\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}F_n,\quad H:=\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}G,\quad\p:=\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}\p_n:F\to H.
$$ 
It suffices to show that the morphism $\p(a):F(a)\to H(a)$ between the stalks at $a$ induced by $\p$ is not an epimorphism. This is clear because $\p(a)$ is the natural morphism 
$$
\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z\to\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z.
$$
